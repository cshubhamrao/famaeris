            " rejected.   But there were just so many clues leading back to it. So many unanswered lines of text and phone calls, so many missed messages and missed calls.   I don't know what I would've done if I was a better version of her.    I think about her often. I'm sorry for this one, though.    Maybe if she'd only understood that I was her, maybe we could both have grown up a little bit.      *No chance.*   It’s a very small window right now. She doesn't even have an adult at home, and the kids are terrified and angry.   But she doesn't even seem aware of it.    *Maybe... she just has this.*   *So you're like the little girl with autism.*   *It's hard to know what to do.*   *It’s so hard to get help.*   *But do it.*   *This feels so damn good.*   *That’s so hard to ask. You can’t explain why.*   *I don’t understand... but you will.*   *Tell us.*   *It’s so hard to figure out, but you have to know.*   “Oh no! No no!” A scream rings out, echoing in the silence.   *What is it? What do you do?*   “Just give me more milk, mom. Don't worry about anything else.”  ——————————————————————————————————-    After my phone call, things got… weird. The calls got hung up. The texts got ignored.     The phone call that made me start running was a total troll call. A sick, twisted bastard, someone who didn't get a taste of my own medicine, who told me his secret. His new identity would be the greatest adventure I’d ever had, and he wanted me desperately, even to the point of begging for his help.   I looked around, but no one was home, and the door to the garage was open. No one was inside.    I was confused, but when the sound of clicking filled the house, I didn't care.    I grabbed my phone and dialed, but as soon as I pulled the call, no one answered. No one answered on the phone. All I heard was a muffled scream, followed by the footsteps of a shadow that must've stepped in through the hallway to the left.   “You here?” I said, with a frantic desperation.   The phone rang again.   And she was gone.    And I heard another muffled scream.   “Help! You need to stop moving! Help!”  But none come any closer.   She must’ve done something, because, one minute later, I saw blood in the hallway on the other side. She’d just taken a step, and vanished into it.     My phone lit up.   “Emergency at house, please!!”  I sat quietly in stunned disbelief.    *Oh god. Oh god. Oh God.*   *Stop running!!!*   *Please! Don’t run anymore, please!*   “HELP! What’s going on?” I begged, feeling like my brain had just frozen.   “We need to get you inside, mom. He won’t come in, not now, not ever.”   I stared at the ground.    *Help!*    The sound of running filled my ears again. That familiar sound of footsteps and the sound of blood and the sound of slamming slammed down my door. I wanted to cry, but then I realized it was just clicking. I could just hear the footsteps downstairs, and the crunch of the tile floor.    “HELP!” There was a crackling sound of running from the kitchen.   The door was now wide open.   *What… what's going on?*   Her heart sank. I’ll admit it now -- I knew we had to go, that it was hopeless but it was also something new, something like nothing I’d ever felt before. We were all going to hell at the end -- that’s why she’d finally called.   “HELP!”   We raced to the kitchen, frantically running to get milk.   She looked down at me with a terrified look on her face and shook her head.   *No!* I screamed. “Get out of here! *Get out now*, she said.   *Please!* \n",

            " of the place was her, still sitting up.  “Can you hear what I’m saying? Can you hear my pain?” The voice from outside spoke again, and I heard his hands gripping my legs.  I looked up. They were standing above and in front of us, blocking our view.  “Can you hear him? Can you see him?”  “I’m sure,” I replied.  The other two moved on to the room in a panic, but both of them were gone before we could say a word.   As we watched the room, the voices drifted to a stop.  I heard them again, and I heard how one of the voices was coming from the ceiling.  All of it was coming from the ceiling, and the sounds they were making were so loud I could barely hear myself scream.  “The light,” the voice went on, “the light the only one left,” the voice said, “it's coming from the ceiling, and it's coming from the ceiling the only light left.” I heard the sound start to get closer.  Then the screaming began.  *She had to hear you scream,* the voice said. The voice grew louder as the screams increased in volume.  *She had to hear it.”*  Every one of the screams were coming from the ceiling, but I heard every one of the screams and the voices in a whisper.  As the screams grew closer, I heard the sound from the roof.  The sound of the ceiling.  The sound that came from the ceiling.  It was coming from the goddamn ceiling.  The voices were coming from the ceiling.  My heart started to race.  The voice began to ring in my ears more and more, growing louder and more frantic.  It started to grow close.  To a point where, just before the screaming stopped, the sound from the ceiling rose to a point where I could absolutely make out where it was coming from.  The ceiling was right there in front of us, the only part of it I could still see.  The second I got used to it, I went to get my camera from my phone (and I *messed* my phone so badly I ended up tearing out the screen) and tried to look up at the ceiling but could not because I was too afraid.  So I couldn’t do anything.  And when I finally figured out what I *knew* about the ceiling, I left it and tried to get back to my cabin to find my family.  But I couldn't.  I couldn't look down.  I couldn't look down.  I couldn't find my parents.  I couldn't find my mother, and I couldn't find my dad.  I called my sister in the middle of our driveway.  She was right next to me on the phone, but I answered the phone in the middle of the night and I just about fell asleep.  I went back over the area by myself, walking into the next woods to take a look in each place.  I was so proud of myself when I realized I *knew* about their voices and where they were coming from.  I remembered they were coming from the ceiling, but I didn't want to look.  That scared me.  I woke up on the side of the road.  My family was gone.  I still had my camera, though.  The camera.  I was so mad it started to go haywire and I was going crazy.  I thought I’d never get out of bed but I didn't want to look on the camera again.  I was just so tired.  I was trying to think in my head what would I do if the voices never stopped coming back.  If I just knew how I felt in my head.   It was the first time I had an answer to my questions, though.  It made me so mad that I started to go to see my mother.  She was talking to me as usual, her voice the same, but not loud or aggressive.  I went over to her, and I was angry.  I yelled at her for hours about what it would be like if I just gave up on getting rid of the camera.  She said, “I still want that camera to see you,” she cried.  I said, “She still wants to see me.  I always have been here.  So did she.  Do you have a camera?”  The camera was gone.  My whole body was trembling with anger and fear and I started to cry.  I wanted to tell myself that, as sick and twisted as I was, I loved my mother, and I always would.  So I kept looking at the camera from afar and I could tell.  The thing I saw most\n",

            " slashed the rope.  I jumped out of my skin when I realized it wasn't the guy with the axe. It was the woman I was worried. She was a wreck. She was in an accident and we buried her under dirt and grass and made her sit on the dirty porch and watch us dig a new one. She died a week later.  The neighbors kept telling me they were afraid the kids would go down the hill and get lost.  That wasn't so for me. I had my own car. Not just anymore. Not for a long time anyway.  I got a job at an airplane repair shop. I spent time every month fixing other people's broken things. My customers mostly consisted of school kids and their parents who'd come in and out of work and return late. Sometimes my coworkers would help them out, too. I'm not saying I was a good employee. I had always told my patients they'd find out and I'd be upset if I wasn't. Still, I was a good manager. I didn't let the way I treated my patients cause them to leave or upset me. They didn't make the cut, so you always got the impression.   But I was a good manager. My patients. They made me feel better. They kept telling me I’d make them proud. They wanted to keep talking. To keep making new friends.  *I couldn’t let you go.*   So far things were OK. I kept my word, but that wasn’t what I wanted people to think. I started looking at the scars. The ones where I cut off a bit of skin to reveal the cancer. I started seeing the signs.  **It was a long time ago: long enough that you know when you were old, a long time before you were born.**  It was the last word I spoke about the book. Before I left for a new job, I called my wife and we chatted as we left for that office job. I didn’t want her to think I wasn’t home. Not when I hadn’t even seen her through the cracks. “Who are you?” I asked.   She looked up for a moment. I knew how serious she was. “I’m not your wife. You’ll always be my patient.”  They stopped talking for a while and then she said, “You have to wait a minute.” I didn’t get it at the time. I was on a bad income, after all — but how could I wait a minute? She told me the truth. She thought I’d lost it after a while, but she kept telling me that I needed to hold on to it before I walked out. I didn’t really understand why she thought that. She always said she didn’t remember the last time she felt anything. I mean, sometimes I felt it, but my mind could forget pretty much anything, right?  Maybe I thought something was wrong or maybe I was experiencing a flashback of something, but it seemed way more like déjà vu.  It was never the words I spoke as a doctor: “You have to wait a minute, right, before you take the appointment.”  But she started to say those words again. I didn’t care enough to stop her. Then I started to wonder if or when the book would ever get read or would the patients ever understand. Maybe, if I tried to read it, I could make them understand when they broke something. I got frustrated.  **You have to wait a minute before you take your next appointment.’**   I kept thinking about my books. After all, they seemed to work better that way. They reminded me of a script. They reminded me of a book I'd read in a bookstore a while back that seemed to help me remember my first book-instructor when I was a child.  I couldn’t stop repeating the exact same phrase, and it kept the words from getting out of hand. I don’t know why I kept saying it. I guess it was the 'in your face' quality of the words. I was a good doctor, in other words.   But I started to wonder if this was what it really said. **We need a new book before you take your next appointment.’**  It wasn't as long-winded and complicated as I remembered. It was simple: we need to keep you reading. Let you know what’s going on. Let your head be clear. Let your imagination be wild. If you keep going through our procedures and treatments the way they were given, you might keep them. Let them guide you and keep you going. Please, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, let this happen in a way you wouldn’t have to remember a doctor�\n",

            " ordered from.  She had to take a break soon, now, and so I thought it would be best to just go home and relax, take a little time where I could just talk to her in private.  I came home and asked her a bunch of questions I didn't plan to ask later. She had a lot of questions, too, so I wanted to ask as soon as I had everything out of the way. I was so dumb, I should never have asked questions of hers at all - there was no way she would remember these questions.  And then there was that weird text. It was from her, and she wasn't responding to the text and the messages weren't responding.  But something about the message made me remember the text I remembered from my old phone and I knew she had been following the directions on the message. I figured she'd gotten one out somehow and was texting me or something of the sort. I have no idea how she got my old phone, though - she just sent me to her Facebook profile and tried to hide it from me or something, just like I remembered.  I had no idea what to do - just asked her what the message was about - I should have asked her what she was text messages with. I got her to respond to me. But when I went to do so, the screen flashed red as soon as my mind started thinking about it; it was a countdown for something, and they never said what. Maybe I thought they were planning something funny and didn't respond? But then it was a response and I think she had gotten the message from someone she liked, just a little bit ahead of me that day.  It took about four hours before she finally said she was getting the message, which is how long I had been waiting on this. She sent me a reply after all (which I found out is how long the emails are).  \"Hey! You've got the message, now shut the fuck up and read it!\"  You should read it now. It's long and hard, it's long as all the messages, and it's worth reading the whole length. You can see every line before they're too long is what I mean.  \"Hi, you big bastard,\"  \"Fuckoff. I didn't send the message before I sent you. I'm not your fuckin** phone. What the fuck is this shit? What's the message saying?\" I don't know if I should read it again.  \"Don't read any more. Get it out and keep reading. Do it right now. I’m in the mood for some 'action' right now. See you on Saturday.\"  There was a pause, then she said \"*I don't fucking get it, I don't get it, you're stupid, I don't get it, fucker*”  She was clearly talking to me now, as she kept reading it and then continuing to read it. I didn't see any more responses to the messages and I was confused.  \"*I don't get it, I don't get it? You keep going because I don't get *it*. You can't read this. You can't read it. You don't even read the replies, you fucking retard. You're stupid.\"  *Well, okay. But the text messages aren't going away. But I understand you can't read them, okay? They *are* continuing, because apparently there’s some 'action' in them, so I have to give her some sort of response.  I didn't see the message until a few minutes after I'd read it. The conversation continued, and I read it again.  \"Hey, you'll see.\"   It wasn't until that night that I took them down a notch and sent her out the text messages, though. She got them back and sent them to everyone - I've heard them from her now, and even from a new phone. She's going to do it again tonight and I need whatever she’s going to send me, to tell me exactly what her reply is about.  As for all the 'replying' - I was trying to figure it out. I didn't see her last night. She started writing them and it only took me a second to get it right enough to reply.  \"*I didn't mean to tell you,*I just didn't do it in that way.*I didn't mean my phone. I didn't get it from here, I didn’t send it. You know it was real. I just saw you have to have the text messages, right? So, it wasn't my fault or anything. It was a stupid mistake, just a stupid mistake. I'm sorry I messed up and didn't get more warning. That’s about as bad as it should be.\"  She sent me a response after this.  \"*I hope you weren't planning on answering the\n",

            " so as not to mention he couldn’t really remember any of the girls.   And yet. I can’t help but feel as though a very odd, haunting, and deeply familiar connection was made between me and that particular, and that particular, girl, if I had the chance. My mother, my sister, my best friend, a strong, strong, and courageous person, she had died twelve years prior, aged sixteen, just a few short months after I was born, and I would’ve been her baby, had it not been for a life on the side. My mother had suffered from severe bouts of depression, and I remember thinking that she must’ve been one of the most beautiful children I’d ever known, as well as a hell of a lot of other things, but I had always been haunted by those vivid memories of her, I was, I was, I had felt a certain numbness as if those memories had haunted me, and I wasn’t surprised to learn that she had been suffering from a mental breakdown.    I couldn’t remember how strong a mother I thought she had been, how much she meant to me, how much my life had meant to her. I didn’t *know* how strong a mother she had been, but I knew that I’d never have been able to endure the pain, the suffering, the emptiness without her, and without her it would have been over, that it would have been over, she would have fallen through, but it wouldn’t have happened.    After I was born, my mother wasn’t the same again. She hadn’t stopped smiling, was a lot more energetic than I had ever seen her, but she also hated babies. I mean I was her least favourite child, and she hated them. And I suppose the only way I know how to cope with the pain or the void of knowing her, is to give in and allow it to pass without me ever knowing that she was dead, and to give in willingly, even when she was very weak, knowing that she was not coming back, that I’d never get to see her.             \"You know, I’d really loved babies. Not that she was perfect, I don’t think. I was so jealous of all the beautiful girls my age. My sister was five years older than me. My mother would always tease those girls, tease them silly, but she was my least favourite, I think. My mother was my only sister, my only sibling, the one I loved the most. I’ve known her for a long time, but I never met her face to face. She never spoke to me, and she didn’t see her after I’d been born. I didn’t want to be the one to see her again, so I kept it to myself, it was too late for a new one.\"      \"My only other friend, the one that’s always smiling, and who gave me the nickname “Cinnamon Charlie”... she’s gone. She met me in high school, but I didn’t know who she was before, and she didn’t know what I’d been through, so she didn’t notice me, and we were never friends again. She’s gone now.”          \"No one ever told me she was dead, or why. She’s not like that at all. She always saw me smiling, and always looked to me with understanding. When I said she was beautiful, I mean it, and it made her, my mother... I mean, I don’t know if she can make it again. I’m not sure where she’s going. I don’t think she can get to the other side of the wall, the side with her mother. I’ve done my best to look after her, but I can’t remember the words to them, my mother said that’s why she had to die. That she must die so that I’d never have to face her again.                                                    \"I’m just worried that she didn’t have the strength to look after her mother, or she’d die, and that she thought I loved her too much for her to die, though my mother had died much her own time, and I thought things over too soon before deciding a new adventure started, and all I know is that she’s\n",

            " in her neck.   She pulled me up. Our eyes met. The doctor was beside herself with fear- I was already feeling the blood sting.    “You okay?”   I looked up. She had her arms around me and held me close.   I had my back to the doctor, but she held me close under her arm, my head resting on her shoulder. I was shaking.   “It’s ok,”   “You’re ok.”   The doctor rubbed her back. “I’m really sorry for what I did to you. I don’t know how you got away with it, but I’ll make sure you feel really bad during your coma.”   “I’m *alive*,” I tried to say, but she stopped me. She looked down at my face.   “Yeah,” I said, “it must be nice to be dead in a coma.”   “Do you have dreams?”   'No', the doctor snapped. “I’m not actually here alive. You’ve probably figured that out already.”   “You know that already.”   It’s strange, but that’s the most accurate description he gave us. I’m really sorry. There won’t ever be a good-bye chapter for this story.  I knew it. I’ll be honest with you, I could get some of the information out of it, even though I knew I’d be in for a rude awakening. If you’re a friend of mine and you have no idea what I’m going to say next, I didn’t really have any issues letting you know. I just wanted to let you know that this is not over yet. So I’d like our friends on Reddit to do it for me.  I’m going to tell you what he says to this particular hospital. He tells them all of the doctors about the patient's situation in the hopes of opening things up for discussion. When it comes to those discussions, it becomes very difficult. I’m not sure if it's possible for one person to comment, or even know that there exist some such person with the knowledge, but it is a start.   “A’lief?” the doctor asks, sounding slightly incredulous.   “I don’t think so.”  “That’s not too good.”  “You have to understand, an unconscious person has no brain in their body. No information about their mind that would allow them to make sense of it. Now, if there was a brain, a conscious one, you would have to figure out how they made that happen.”  “But then it just gets too many questions.”  “And this is where I agree with you. If there is a brain, it is more than a mystery no longer. It is evidence of an answer. And a good answer leads to answers. Now, my job is to make one, an answer, an answer that has been left unanswered. But my questions and worries are more like you asked, and a lot of the patients come to me. They ask about their past, maybe they ask about their childhoods, maybe they ask about the patient’s present situation; I’ll guess that we have to admit too many of these questions. They want answers, and I’d have to tell them no matter how much they may want one.”   “The only problem is that the answers you want might not be enough.”   “Well, there is some comfort,” the doctor’s grip tightening on his arm, “to relax your nerves. But I’m afraid that the answers you want won’t be enough.”   “How?”    “I’m afraid that there’s no answer left. This isn’t over yet.”   “But no one knows what this thing is, or what it will become,” he said sadly. “We have no way of knowing. Just wait a few years, and someone will. They’ll come, and they’ll come and they’ll come and… then *the* thing will become known.  For everyone’s sake, we’ll be watching for a while, of course; we’ll try to keep them away from the *other* world. But that’ll take awhile. If we’re not careful, some of them will end up making\n",

My door locks are locked from the inside, but I can hear you're moving things around.\"  \"*Yes, I move things around all the time. I can hear you from miles away. Just as an example. Say you get one of these little traps and you press the right key, and I hear something fall in but before you get within shouting distance, it bounces back up again. The trap is only about fifteen feet away from you, so each time it gets harder to hear, and is more distant. One minute you're in it, and the second you leave it, it's gone. The moment you press the left key the trap is gone too, but before you take the trap it's gone forever. It stops you from leaving it, but you can't leave it, so you press the wrong key.\"  \"*When you're ready,*\" I said.  He nodded and then opened his book, pulling out a map and compass. \"And it says that your current position is just a few thousand feet away from the wall. I have to cross that field of red lines in a matter of seconds. I'm heading back to the city now, and I don't know how best to get back. I can hear them moving away, and I'm heading in the opposite direction. I left the shelter, but I feel like I'm headed straight into whatever this will be at any moment.\"  \"*I'll find you,*\" I said. \"As soon as I return. And you, uh, have a radio.\"  \"*That’s amazing,*\" said Jim. \"And if you get it, I can tell the rest of us to come get you.\"  \"*No wait. No one’s going to stay here. But I want to keep moving. This isn’t a fight that’s worth fighting.*\" I turned his book around and pointed to a nearby building.  I stood up and hurried back into the shelter, the radio playing soothingly in the background. I turned on the radio and typed some numbers, hoping for a different tune. But the only tune I heard was a familiar lullaby.    &nbsp;  [part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bz0cdl/im_a_cop_and_ive_got_seven_hounds_and_i/)I woke up this morning around 7AM. I have only slept well past 3 in the morning once or twice in my life.  I was pretty clear early on about how the storm was going to strike where we have been dealing with tornadoes and hail. My wife said she didn’t know. But she did tell me that the storms have never struck anything quite like this. A couple days later, there was a flash of lightning at about 5 AM. We both watched it happen, and realized we had seen it happen the whole time.  We were able to get up early for work that morning. It was just a little storm, but I knew my wife wouldn’t sleep through it.  While making coffee, she said she had seen a small black figure come up in the clouds. She said it reminded her of when you were a kid and you heard a soft rustling sound as you walked down the path behind your house. You turned to see what was staring directly into your eyes. It was a small, almost fuzzy shape, and it was floating in mid-air.  It started to rise up, and as you walked closer, you could make out the outline of a face. The figure was the same as it was facing us. It was almost invisible, so I didn't even notice until later that night it was out there in the open.  I called 911, and while waiting for the dispatcher to arrive, I saw the figure fly off, and then it was gone. Even though its face looked exactly the same as it was when it came over. I got a call back later that night about the missing figure. Again, it wasn’t too obvious where it was, but when I told the dispatcher I did see it move quickly away from us, it was almost impossible to tell where it was. In the end, the figure just stopped flying toward our house.  It was a few hours later that night, right before 7:30 PM. We’d been out to get the girls – Sarah was in the car with dad – and then returned to the house. I remember thinking it would\n",

            " with up the front of his truck with a crowbar and began breaking in, pulling on his suspenders.  I felt the first sting of Jason's gun and turned back down the road and continued walking.  “The kid’s face looked a lot better with your help.”  Jason pulled his gun out, dropping it on the ground.  “What do you want, Dad?” He asked, his voice quiet in the darkness.  “I want someone who can help you.”  I glanced over at the other car, which was now blocking the driver’s side, my father’s name written above the driver’s seat.  No one dared turn around.   Jason’s truck, which had been standing still, pulled out from the forest and swerved onto the road.   “Why doesn’t he go with you? I don’t want him with me.” I said, still looking in my direction.  Jason glanced and turned, nodding.  “So, what did you want to ask me first?” Jason asked.  I swallowed and turned back toward my father.   “I just... I don’t know.  I mean, do you remember the kid?”  “Of course I do.” He’d said.  “Why the hell wouldn”t he remember?  Jason raised his brow and moved his head slowly around the corner to find the car in front of him.   “You know about that kid?”  The driver’s side door slammed shut behind him as he slammed his foot on the gas.  Just loud enough to make me jump out of my seat and turn back to Jason.  “What do you think the point of this was?”  He shrugged and pointed at the car.  “The point was to stop him. “He was a bad driver, and there was no point in just telling the police if he knew about us. But then why did he follow me?”  I couldn’t even begin to answer that question.   Jason’s truck rumbled and the driver's side door swung inward so the driver and passengers would have a clear view around Jason.  The truck slammed off of the road, and it didn’t slow down until it had hit another car. Another truck followed behind.  I kept my eye behind the truck as Jason drove and looked behind me as his next turn came up.  The driver’s side door shut behind me in the backseat of the truck and I was once again alone and staring out.  The truck hit another car and the door opened from above.  Jason’ door slowly opened on himself from the truck’s opening and he closed it, making his face look very grim.  His eyes seemed to widen for a moment as he looked at my father and then back to me.  My father smiled and said, “Yeah, I figured.  I figured your dad was right.  There’s always a reason why some people are good at driving.”   A strange feeling filled my stomach, but it quickly turned into confusion once it actually sunk in that I didn’t know why he was telling me but I figured this was normal somehow.   We’d both been on the road for over a day before I could remember the car driving away on the right hand side.   I’d forgotten about the other cars.  It never occurred to me to check because I felt like it would take away from the thrill of our time together.   Even now I don’t know how much I could tell if I ever remembered seeing another car turning around the corner.  It might have been a passenger car, or maybe a truck.  It might have been the same van Jason had in the truck.  That had to be it.  It had to!  I was always so scared of that van.  I wanted to get out of his truck so bad all of those years ago when we were getting drunk and telling all our friends that the highway was the highway.  It wasn’t until that day he took it home and set it on the side of his truck.    I couldn’t help but wonder if he had seen the van come back.  If it had crossed over into this little backwoods area and turned around.   Then I wouldn’t have remembered.    But there it was.  A long drive over into the trees, the same van with Jason’s green eyes and dark hair.  The van was parked on the side of the road, and the driver stood in the open and waited.  My hands slid over the steering wheel as I stared out into the distance. \n",

            " He was in a coma, but the doctors said he should last another week or so. When he was able to move and speak, they tried to get me to help him with the physical pain he was inflicting on himself. The doctors told me to just ignore it and just forget about it.  That night, I stayed up all night listening to it.  The first thing my husband said when he turned on the radio was “I’m going to help the people at the gas station. They need a voice.”  I watched him climb into the truck and start to drive out from the gas station with the police on foot. A few minutes later, he pulled over and began walking towards the gas station where he was going to throw his wrench into the pump.  He started to walk towards a wall of gas station stores, but stopped on a wall just outside a store. He looked directly at it and almost screamed with fear in his voice. He didn’t try to pick a pocket and was careful not to let go of his arms.  “Who is it?” A cop asked from up top, “You are the one who must be helped.”  “Where is it?” I gestured at the radio’s speaker. “Listen I’m going to search for the voice. Did you hear it?”  “I’ve heard a scream before. Maybe it’s just my head,” the cop muttered, “but look for it. I will be coming for you in half an hour. Take your family home with you.”  I looked at the radio and smiled with my heart.  “Dad, what is that sound?” I whispered next to him, excitedly, “It is the voice of a woman, please come see for yourself.”  “What? I couldn’t hear her.”  “Oh don’t be so serious.”   “No, this is her screaming.”  “Mommy please, look for the woman.”  “Look outside,” the officer said, “she probably just disappeared out that window.”  I walked towards my father’s truck and opened it up.  I was surprised to find his shirt dirty and his pants torn.   “You’re lucky you didn’t die,” he mumbled and wiped away a tear.  I took a seat, “did you see what he looked like? He looked like you, did he not?”  “Of course I did,” the cop said with a smile, “and yes, I remember him.”  I waited patiently as my dad finished wiping away his tears and we looked into the window.  We could see an older woman standing near the window.  She had long blonde hair in a tight bun and was wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt.  She smiled into the camera as she approached the gas station.  “Hey mommy.” She walked up to her and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I noticed you coming today?”  My father raised his eyebrow, “No I wasn’t here.”  “He was here earlier?”  My mother nodded and motioned for the gas station to stop.   “Now is your last day,” I said and reached to pick up my father’s lunch.  It was in a glass box.  I walked up to the front of the store that he had just left.  “Well the lady is here,” I said with a smile, “her smile seems to only get brighter.”  The woman walked up to the register, “the woman who just came in the gas station looking for a woman.”  “Oh, hello,” my father said from his spot at the door, “you’re dad’s father.”  I looked at him and he was smiling at me.  “He’s been living here with his family for over 30 years now.”  “That’s the family that adopted him.”  “What… you say?”  The man smiled back and said, “his last name’s Silverstone.”  He winked at me and let out a huge grin, “come on man, it’s time for you to get home now!”  I ran to the gas station and jumped into my father’s truck.  I got out of the truck as quickly as I could and walked up to the wall outside.  It was covered in some sort of brown dirt, but\n",

            " the body. I felt numb, but a sense of fear overtook me, forcing me to crawl backwards into the walls until I was finally sure I was alone, my mind swimming in a sea of pain.     It was the middle of the night.     The boy sat upright in bed. Fear and dread threatened to consume him, and while I struggled to maintain eye contact with the mirror, the image of the boy who looked like a caricature of a grown man and the image of a dead baby were now drowned out in the quiet quiet and heavy breathing.       He looked like a man who was on the verge of death.        “I don't know what to do,” I said. I wasn’t sure where my voice had come from... but I had to try to remain present for him.        “I can’t.        What will you do?” The voice in my head didn’t respond. I thought about a day or two.        “I don’t know,” the voice in my ear didn’t respond. I wondered why.          I got up. My arms gripped my sides. My hands were numb and I had a headache. I reached the window and peeked outside.          Nothing. I stared a moment, then reached the handle.         “What is it?” I sat up. The window was dark, but I noticed the outline of the boy, hiding behind it from the bottom.        “We need to get the police in.”         The sound of a car door creaked echoed through my head. Why the hell that would happen.        “How am I supposed to call if I’m on the other side?” I reached the window and pulled my ear out. I had to get away from him. He was too sharp and dangerous, though. So much too sharp and dangerous for a thirteen-year-old. “Help here,” I said.              I grabbed my phone and dialed the number on my watch. I pressed there. It took forever and as soon as I called again, they hung up. I turned back to my body and felt a sickening pain, like a needle being jabbed into me. I reached up for my phone and dialed the number again. It hung up, and so did I.             The phone hung up. I was so angry with them. They didn’t deserve to hurt me that bad.          A chill crept up into my spine. I turned my head so I was facing the mirror. The boy stood there, his back facing me, face down. What the *hell* was he doing?         “What-- WHAT happened?” I heard the *hilarious* ringing in my ear.            “Nothing,” I said. I could hear myself thinking. He *certainly* had not...”             Someone was running around, I realized. They weren’t moving fast enough for me to run after them. If he didn’t return, I just might. And after his departure, nothing else was moving in the same way.          I called a cab and got into the car with the back doors locked. A very different feeling of apprehension and trepidation crept up my arms as we pulled onto the road again. We made it to my apartment and closed the doors behind us.         I felt the sting of what came up in the back of my throat, but there wasn’t much. I called my sister and she freaked out, but I couldn’t be alone with someone. She and I shared a flat with her parents in Brooklyn, so sometimes she was right but they always had their weird ways. I had to keep her happy.          I was ready to give up and give all of this another twenty years of my life, but at the very least, I would have to be on the other side of the car, on the other side of the window, with her. That day, I made the most of it.        The cab pulled into the street again and the passenger door opened behind me.  \n",

He listened, then asked if I felt okay. I felt Sam\\'s respect and love, and asked how things were going for him. It made sense. We were double-time and hadn’t been together since Hwan rushed us into the office to get a job, so he had new challenges every once in a while. Then he walked away.  Cute, right?  But he left the door open, and the landline as a passive-voice option for the front-end recruiters. I checked the old voicemail. He was one of hers, so her place was safe. The place was clean, the assistants had been great about giving me fresh arguments and reasons to stay employed, and I had a lot of positive feedback on this, suggesting hiring people that would help me move in with the group.  Well, I left the job, and in a week, I was gone. I didn’t consider myself laid off, but there were other cuts to furloughs and layoff notices, so it’s not exactly \"old\".  I didn’t have a severance package. But I pulled together a bit of cash after I took a few months off, and quit my job and hired an assistant to do internships with me.

She had an assistant, but she was very imprecise about it, which scared me. I tried to dismiss it as a late notice job, or women winning the lottery. I yelled at her about the job, but her voice was heavy with suspicion and it stung.

              "\"I used to be self-employed.  It didn't take long for me to make a mistake.  I was sitting on a construction site in my yard when a young woman approached.  She was dressed in a short-sleeved white dress, and her hair was blonde.  My heart dropped as I watched the girl, now identified as 27-year-old Samantha, walk up to her.  She pointed to a particular spot in the yard she wanted to inspect.  Near the entrance to the property.  She said, “Do you mind giving me a call so we can talk?” Samantha responded.  She asked if Lena was home, but Lena was in the kitchen.  When I answered, she said she was just planning to go through and retire.  She didn't know much about construction, but Samantha insisted that Lena did, and I agreed to listen to her.  After talking to her for a bit, I told her that I was open to the idea of staying and talking after work, and I wouldn't need a call after that.  I didn't really think they would ask her for hers.  After I finished, I decided to end the interview.  Because I could hear my boss' voice as I walked into the shadows.  Michael Coan asked,  “Your mother just called and asked you to come over.  She said she wants to talk to you. Is that okay?” I hung up the phone.  I didn't say anything when I got home.  I called Samantha, and she said she was in.  She actually sounded excited, with the accent that gave the impression of an interview.  I don't know if it's the same accent, but she did sound excited.  I told her I'd call after work, and I hung up the phone.  She said she'd call after school, and I told her to meet me in the parking lot of a mall.  I went inside and found Samantha in her bedroom.  Naked.  She had on a lip-bag.  She was curled up against the wall.  Sitting on top of the bed was a mattress.  Soft stuffed animals surrounded her.  As soon as I saw what she was looking at, I jumped off of the bed and ran.  The carpet was soft but scraggly.  The hair was grey.  The clothes were sparse.  As I rounded\""

            "A confused, terrified woman pushed me out of the way as I exited my truck. I pulled my battered bag into the dark, clutching the bag like it was life or death. I didn’t have any clothes on.  I must’ve looked like Jesus eight years ago when I couldn’t take the sight of a prostitute.  We kept the lights on and walked briskly to the transom.  We unlocked the red button, and lobbed the transom’s coffee mug across the table to the empty seat. I drank it and looked up, expecting the mundane to resume its usual bizarre then normal conversation with several other men what seemed to be every job.  But there it was, six feet two inches of thin and fat, hung from the ceiling, and flesh that looked nothing like the woman I seen crawling down the sidewalk.   The transom’s man nodded, clearly using a crutch.  “I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said, looking down at the ground before adding, “my check was last done eight years ago I don’t do that kind of business anymore.”  “These are some of the older workers; this particular one, I’m guessing, is pretty old.”  I sighed.  “Apologies. I know a peep guy.”  “I see? And what’s he doing with this?”  As though reading my mind, she appeared to be responding to my words, but just before I finished she glanced over at our transom, and then returned to her work.  The transom finally did clear after about a minute of this, and back ordered, sending four footers out and boasting that they’d not have to deal with a transom this time.  There was a cab pull up outside the transom. I got out of my seat and punched the make-shift tapper.  “They bounced it back at me?”  The driver, who spoke perfect – if cracked – English, asked, “Of course, ma’am,” and gave out the number of the corresponding cab company.  I looked up when I was in the driver’s seat, and the woman seated closest to me, Bumble, looked at me in fear.  “Our transom\n"

But I can do some good.  Here's what I do for a living. I contribute to the design and implementation of large scale computer networks. In fact, that's pretty much what I do for a living.  I am regularly out of the office all day, doing various little errands like scheduling meetings, helping people in pain, digging up old computers, finding swapped cables, reprogramming old processors, and replacing batteries.  But one project stands out from the rest.  It's an extremely elaborate project and I use it as a hobby.  I tend to save up for a bit, spend long periods developing something and then come back to work as a result. But not on the Internet… not ever. It's insane.  Forgive me if this ends up being too much of a mystery for the reader.  My current pay is about US$275/month. This is the amount of money I think it would take to write this, all while having to cover major expenses of a government job (like renting a client house, phones, and everything else).  As a engineer, this pays all the bills. It is what I do best.  So one of the first things you should do is to understand my profession. \n"

            "We have a problem. Call us at (626) 672-0800.”   The dispatcher told me this was a police emergency, not a public relations one. I asked the dispatcher if the city had received a call about a missing person, and if so, when I got a call from one of the police organizations that called me.   “I don’t know, I don’t think so. Not even the news said anything.” He said casually, and then hung up.   At first, I thought he was joking, but after talking to the man himself, I think that’s what he meant.    The man said that he went to the man’s house about an hour after I dialed the number. When he said he was, his demeanor changed drastically. He never mentioned the missing woman and he never mentioned her name. He just said that she was strange, but said it seemed like she could only communicate with the sound of his breath. He didn’t elaborate much further, just said he thought she was strange.   The last thing I heard from him was that he just wanted me to talk to him. We talked a little bit over the phone, and then I never heard from him again.   Since then, no sightings, but I heard about one. About a week ago I called a boy I knew who lives next door to my house. He lived in our neighborhood, and he told me about a strange occurrence that happened last month.   “His mother died last month, and I haven’t talked to him since. A couple weeks before it happened, she brought home a new dog, and I took him home with her, but I couldn’t get a good look at him after he’s brought home. So, I called to check in on him.” He said, and then hung up.   I was pretty freaked out when I heard this, but I told him about the strange sighting he’d had, and that I was interested in getting more information before contacting him.    “So, just to preface this, can you tell me a bit about yourself, sir?” I asked.   “I’m a friend of the son of a bitch living next door to me. He told me about the strange thing that\n",

            "”Liar,” I said. “The only way to get rid of the bodies is to burn them.”  I looked out the window to the open crescent moon and laughed.  “Or bury them in the cemetery.”  No one said anything.  “It’s just a stupid game.”  He continued, “It’s not like we haven’t been doing it for years now.”  I sighed, and said, “Maybe we should just start a new game. What are you waiting for?”  “Okay…Okay.”  “Well we have been doing it for years, it’s just that… well, it kinda feels like it’s been… a lifetime for me.”  “Like that?”  He cackled, and I laughed at him.  I looked past Jeff, who was now drinking too hard not to laugh too.  Still, I still felt like laughing. Like someone had to pay for the amusement, because nobody wanted to be the only ones laughing.  “I do feel like it’s been a lifetime, but maybe it’s been a thousand years.”  “Or what?”  “Maybe a thousand years.”  I looked out the window to the street.  But we weren’t yet there.  It was still dark outside.  There was no traffic.  “There’s still people out there.”  He looked at my neighbor looking out her window.  “Maybe they’re still out there somewhere.”  I frowned, because he was right. And maybe he should be thanking me instead.  “And remember, some of them are our former students.”  “I’ll send the police. That sounds like good advice.”  He looked at Jeff.  “Is that true? A thousand years?”  He laughed a bit.  “You bet your right nut sack there. You look like you need three or four shots of espresso every morning.”  I nodded, and left the store.  Jeff came back minutes later.  “Jeff, do you think the police will do a darn thing?”  “\n",

I was going to leave the security people out of the loop, and that’s where things went wrong. That’s where you get the “oh, he won’t leave the room because he’s too busy watching TV”. Um...yeah, yeah. You’re probably right.” He said. “But I was the one that hired these people. It’s your fault.” I said.  “It just wasn’t a matter of self defense. He kept sneaking in. You know you’re in for a treat when it comes to this job.”  “I know, I know. You’re right. I was hoping for that. And you’re so fucking funny.” I said.  “I’m sorry, but can you describe your first interaction with him?”  I could almost hear the laugh. I did hear it though. I could barely hear myself though so I just nodded. I didn’t want to interrupt, but he just shook his head.  “Right...right before, he came in the room and...”  “Did you try to call him?”  I couldn’t hear the words. I didn’t want to hear them, they were too uncomfortable. “I don’t even think you can feel him.” I said.  “I feel it,” he said.  “I feel his presence, but I can’t see it.”  I nodded.  “I hope it’s good,” he said. “He’s such a good dude.”  “What does he do?” I asked, hoping to silence him.  “He eats,” he said. “Sometimes he eats the people around him. There’s a protocol.”  “What does that mean?”  “He eats those who aren’t healthy, too,” he said. “Not just eat those who are, but eat their guts too.”  “\n",

How did you do that?”  The other man looked as far as he could toward me, and then he bowed down to me.  Mr. K, a college classmate of mine from a previous relationship, winked at me. “Well, it’s part of your job, isn’t it?”  “Do I really need to talk about this to you?”  The other man laughed, and put a hand on my shoulder. “It’s fine. Let’s talk about…what else.”  Mr. K paused, taking out a cigarette lighter. “I…don’t know, I can’t remember. In fact, I don't think I thought about it.”  The other man leaned in, and kissed my forehead. “Well, I think we were having fun, and then everything changed.”  “I guess so.”  “What do I call you?”  “You’d better call me K, Mr. K.”  “And would you believe that something is going to happen that changes your lives?”  “I don’t know. I feel like I’m getting old.”  My eyes drifted back to the living room. My mom, the man, the others, the woman, none of them were in the kitchen. I thought about it for a moment, then I said, “It’s not your fault.”  “Well, thanks for believing me!”                                         “It’s been a pleasure trying my best to assist you and your family, Mr. K,”  I said to my mom. “This is your fault.”  Ms. Lothario looked down at her papers, and then back at me. “I’m sorry, I don’\n",

The man looked at me, slowly at first, until he saw I was staring out of his peripheral vision.  The man sighed.  “There’s only real blood in this universe, you see.  Nobody else can come, even if they wanted to. ”  “We can’t go back to this state!  We gotta get out of here.”   “We gotta get out of here,” I said again.  He glanced up at me, before pointing in the direction of the front door.  “The basement door is broken.  You can’t come in through the door, only the front.”  “Alright, alright.  Let’s just grab our stuff and go.”  Before I could say anything, the man was pulling his pistol out and pointing it at anyone that stood in his path.  “Wait, wait!  The door’s broken!  Please, let him go!” I yelled.  He didn’t know what I was saying.   “Don’t you hear?  There’s only real blood in this universe, and it’s got us here.” The man waved his hands in front of us, before adding: “Maybe we shouldn’t be afraid of it.  Maybe we can be afraid of it.”  I looked at them.  “Please, let him go!” I shouted again.  They did not hear.  I raised the pistol again and pointed at the door, which had then now completely shifted its position.  There was a rattle as it was fired.  “Well, at least it wasn’t a bullet.*” I raised my hand, ready to attack the man.  He had then fired just over my shoulder in a wide arc, behind me.   There was a loud bang.  The man now stood fully upright.   “That’s it!”  The man yelled. “Here we go!”  “Jesus fucking christ!” The crowd\n",

            "The idea of walking through this forest was intoxicating. I expected it to be an endless stretch of white, with rolling hills and trees that grew on trees. Instead, it was flat, a flat sheet of sand and stars falling over the stars. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen. For the first time, I had a reality check – the first good moment of life. I understood.  A world that was not flat. A beautiful place with no mountains, no rain and no trees. A world where there was no time, and no mountains. A world where I was the only human ever to see – and the only one of which the dead have no knowledge.  I walked through a forest, and the forest was beautiful. I had never known there were other worlds – that there were other lives and that I, too, could be one of them. And from my first moment on the forest floor, I learned.   But before I could be fully alive, there were other bodies. There were other people. Some of them were young, some of them were old, all of them were young and very young. All of them wore the same clothes as me – clothes that were my own in many ways – and had very simple faces. The forest was littered with human limbs. Their bones were also in pristine condition. But there was a woman at the far end, with an eerily similar appearance to mine. She bore me a child. Not a smile, not a hug, but a baby.   This woman was very different from the other women. She was very young. Her baby had been abandoned in a clearing, and her body had been preserved in the world I left behind as a child. The bones from her bones were my own and hers. She had lived and she was still living. The woman was in her early twenties. She had a small shop. She lived here a long time and had a very beautiful life.   The woman took me into the forest. She kept the child hidden in a hollow tree. The woman didn’t take me anywhere completely unknown. In fact, she took me on a few strange trails. I think it eventually became my obsession – to find as much as I could about this place – in this world.   The first place I thought I would go was the cemetery. I was the only person that knew about this place. The land itself wasn’t that\n",

The same thing, except there’s no one yelling. Only me, my girlfriend, and the guy at the other end of the phone.  In reality, you’re never in my house. In reality, I don’t have a girlfriend.  I can’t even go to my own house.  And I just saw it.  The sound was coming from the bathroom.  I wasn’t looking behind me, which is where I thought it would hit me, so I just ran into the bathroom and turned off the lights.  It was my girlfriend.  *I saw her.*  She was standing inside a stall about three feet from me. Her legs were spread out on the toilet. I could just barely make out her body.  “I was really worried about you, baby,” she said, looking down at her feet. “And I thought maybe you were just imagining it.”  “I wasn’t, I wasn’t. I did think you were imagining it. But then I saw the bathroom and I realized I was just imagining it.”  And she just stared at me from her perch for a second, then she ran out of the bathroom and into the living room.  I shut her in there for a second, just to be sure she wasn’t in there any more.  Then I left her alone.  I didn’t want her to get hurt or even to think about it this much, so I went for a walk. I went down the empty streets of my home town. I went into the nearby forest and came back out here, to my car. The car was still in the driveway.  When I got inside, everything was normal. There was the usual coffee, the usual paper, the usual coffee and paper bag, and we were still together.  And I just remembered.  She never told me about her secret.  *I thought I loved you, John.*  When I looked into her eyes, I saw that she couldn’t see or hear anything. Her mouth was frozen, like an adult’s writing, and she whispered, “I love you. But sometimes\n",

While this research has revealed many things about these groups that I can reveal to you, one thing I've yet to fully understand is the real reason why they do what they do. The Underground Railroad appears to be a specific example of a larger phenomenon; one that has been discussed in an attempt to solve the mystery that has been brought up in different organizations and different individuals; however, there are many other such groups that I am currently unaware of. I think that it's best if you do not pursue the subject matter further.   I'm not a professional journalist, but I do have the experience to offer you with an explanation of some of these groups. I'll continue to update with any new information that I gather.    ***   UPDATE: This theory has gotten a ton of attention on the streets now; people stopping me on the street, chasing after me, demanding to know what I'm seeing. I've received many calls from anonymous sources, some of these sources have contacted me with personal information about me, which I can reveal at the end of this story. I have not been able to contact any of these individuals; none of these individuals have contacted me personally.   The reason I'm not a spokesperson yet is because the Underground Railroad has yet to publicly announce itself or even identify themselves. That being said, I would like to provide you all with the information I currently have.   For those who are interested, the Underground Railroad is a set of individuals or organizations that have been deemed highly-hazardous.\n",

They were my words. And I took them back.  “But don't you live in a party?”  The girl looked at me and nodded. “You should go to the party?”  “I don't know that much about the party,” I said. “I mean—  “You don't know what I'm talking about.”  “Maybe not,” she said. “I’m just talking about all the colors of the rainbow.”  “Are you kidding, you’re just imagining all this?”  “Oh, maybe I am!”  She put her hand to her mouth and began laughing to herself. “You think all of the colors of the rainbow have a name?

No, when I was told to wait on the other side.  I was supposed to see a man cry in his pajamas.   It wasn’t a problem.  I was supposed to see a man cry.  The world around me began to tear up.  I felt it.  I felt the blood rushing into my eyes.  It was a familiar feeling.  The way someone hands you a cold.  You put them on a pedestal.  The light bends, and tears form.  When the tears meet, they’re big.  And they’re red.  And they’re mine.   But it wasn’t red.  It was something else.  It was a woman’s bare feet.  The ground began to crawl, and I knew I was in for a surprise.  I was standing on the floor.  I was naked.  No sweat on me.  No blood on me.  I was in the middle of a kitchen.  I was in a bathroom.  My clothes were unzipped.  I looked around.  Someone was standing over me.  The light was on.  I thought it was someone in the bathroom.  I did notice they were staring at me.  And then I noticed their hair.  It wasn’t normal.  It was long, black hair.  It was shaved, like the ones you see in cartoons.  It wasn’t a man’s hair.  It was a woman’s hair.  Her hair was brown.  And it was wet.  It looked like blood.  I screamed, but the voice was too loud for me to hear.  I could hear the man standing over me.  He was talking.  I couldn’t hear what he said.  I thought about how he was going to kill me, and how he was going to cut off my hair, and how he was going to throw me in the river.  I was terrified.

No matter how much you try, you can never get back up.  You see, you have two options.  You can try to be happy.  Or you can try to be dead.  You can stop living.  And you can try to be happy.  You can stop living and start living again.  And you can never stop living, I repeat never stop living.  2. I know you have to go back to me.  No matter how much you try, I will not let you go back.  But if you do, I will give you a promise.  Whatever you do, don’t ever look back.  I’ll give you a promise if you tell me what you want.  I can promise you that I’ll do my best to make sure you never do.  3. I will give you a small gift each day.  But don’t keep it to yourself.  I will give you a little bit of anything.  Anything at all.  Anything.  I don’t care what you do for me.  If you want something, you can buy it.  Anything.  It doesn’t matter how old or how old-old you are.  I just want you to have fun.  If you don’t want me to have fun, then don’t buy anything.  4. You can go back to your life.  I won’t force you back to your childhood.  But I want you to remember that.  I want you to remember how much I loved you.  But I also want you to remember that I could never bring you back.  I only gave you a small part of me, but I wanted to give you a whole.  So if you ever want to be happy again, then I hope you can find me.  And if you ever want to stop living, then I hope you can find me. \n",

A car was also found with a driver's seat in the back, partially hidden by the floor. The corpse was clothed in a tattered, pink and blue jeans, and had a broken glass, missing her teeth.    The body was found in a position that made her face appear to be that of a sexual predator. The back of her throat was completely obstructed by the skin, which was stained with blood. The brain showed no signs of forced penetration. The strangest part was that she had been dead for at least three days.    The cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation due to suffocation. No evidence was found of any trauma to the body. The cause of death was ruled as undetermined.    The State did not have any suspects.    The autopsy report revealed that the body had been dead for at least three days prior to the discovery of the body. There was no evidence of any disturbance. There was also no evidence of any trauma to the body. The cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation due to suffocation.    The body was found in a state park. The park is a state park in rural Oklahoma. The area where the body was found is in a very rural area. The area of the park where the body was found is very remote. The area of the park that was searched is in a very remote area and very few people visit the area. The area of the park that was searched is in a very remote area. There is no return route for this vehicle. There is no possible return for this vehicle. The only possible way this vehicle could have gotten to Oklahoma is by land route.

It has to do with the body that was found in a grave. The body that was found in a grave. The body that was just like the one the body that was found in the back seat of this car was found in a grave. It was a body that was just like the one the body was found in.

She was going to bed early that night, so I went to a motel with her, which is where I was staying when I saw her standing in front of me. She was still dressed in her nightgown, but she had a pale, angry expression on her face, so I assumed she was fighting.     “I saw you one night, there’s a little girl in the window of your house, and I wanted to scare her, but I don’t know how you got her, but she doesn’t like you, and I didn’t want to scare her, so I started yelling at you and told you to get her out of the house, but you didn’t listen to me, you just kept walking.

You could take a screenshot of me, record my voice, and have it played back to you in the form of a voice memo. You could take a screenshot of my face, and have it edited to look like me. You could even take a screenshot of my computer, and have me speak to you on the Internet.    It's kind of insane how many of these \"memos\" are created from. I remember when I first started playing the first Grand Theft Auto, I wrote down my address, phone number, and everything. That way, if I ever needed help, I could reach out to people and get them involved in my \"game\".   It's not long until the online communities are thriving. I log into one of these communities and start posting my screen captures. These communities have \"memes\", which are basically funny phrases or slang terms. Memes are basically just pictures of people that look similar and have the same exact words as the person posting. For example, if I post a screenshot of my driver's license with the words “I hate you” in the background, all of the other people who commented on it will automatically make fun of me. The reason I don't say “I hate you” is because I don’t want to be rude to people.   Memes are created, and destroyed, all the time. That’s why I don’t post my real name. I just post it as some sort of online persona. But I can still get people involved in my \"game\" by posting my \"meme\".   The other reason to not say my name is that I don't want to be associated with someone with a criminal record. I was recently arrested once for posting a nude photo of myself on the Internet. I was told by the police that I was going to be committing identity fraud and making a criminal out of myself. That was the first crime I’ve ever been convicted of, so I didn’t think much of it. They said that I was just a careless poster.    I still have a criminal record. I was caught when I was out shopping for groceries.

I told her no and we started talking about life in general.  She said yes to that.  I never wanted to go to the beach but that she wanted to go somewhere new, something I hadn’t seen yet.  I said yes to that too.  We went out and I started telling her stories from the other world.  I said I wanted to go on a bike ride with her.  She didn’t want to go with me, but she agreed to go with me anyway.  We took a short bike ride to the beach and then we parked our bikes on the sand.  She followed behind me and I followed behind her.  When we got near the beach, I asked her if she wanted to go with me.  She said yes.  We walked a bit and then we turned onto the beach.  It was gorgeous.  The beach itself was beautiful.  We walked down the path and I saw something I didn’t recognize.  It was a real boat.  It had a crew on board and the sails.  I recognized the sails because they were the same as the boats I saw at the beach.  The only difference was the sails were bigger.  They were sails that were different.  “Do you want me to get on?” I asked.  “I don’t want to,” she said.  “Okay, fine.  I’m ready.  I got a couple of hours before the sun is fully risen and I’m not worried about it.  I can walk for a couple of hours.”  She got on and then said she wanted to sleep.  I agreed to go with her.

He doesn’t know how to talk, or have any kind of normal conversation.”  He wipes his face, looking down into his tears.  “But I think I can help him.”  “That’s nice,” I say.  He chuckles.  “I’m not exactly sure how to help him, but I think I’d like to try. I mean, yeah, you might be right.”  “That sounds like a good idea.”  “I don’t know. I mean, yeah.”  “Sounds good.”  “I know,” I say. “Well, I guess I can give you some advice.”  “If you say you know, that’s a little too generic.”  I shake my head, not really understanding what she was saying. “No, I mean I don’t know. I don’t know anything.”  “Well, maybe I don’t.”  “Really?”  “Yeah, I think so.”  “What’s wrong?”  “I don’t know.”  “I don’t know what’s wrong with him.”  “Well, I mean he doesn’t have any normal reactions to people. His whole demeanor is messed up.”  “Like a puppet?”  “Like a puppet?”  “I don’t know, I don’t know.

I think I’m checking the room I’ve been in,” he said.  “Or maybe I’ll check the woman’s room.”  “Then who knows what else might be there,” I said.  “I don’t think so.”  He left, and I went to check the other room.  The other room was dark, but I could see a man in his mid-thirties standing in front of a desk, with two chairs facing him.  He was smiling, as usual.  “Thanks for coming,” he said. “And remember: if you see a man in the room with me,” he said, “turn the lights off.”  I turned on the lights, and the man in the room opened the door slowly, walked over to the desk, and gave the same kind of a smile as the man in the room.  He then walked over to the door, and gave a similar kind of smile.  I turned on the lights, and the man walked out the door.  “I can see all the way around you,” I said. “I can see the black.”  I closed my eyes, and waited.  *For a second.*  The lights were still on.  “I don’t know about the other room.”  “But I think I see her, right now.”  “I think so,” I said. “And I can see the other room.”  “And she has a gun,” I said.  “And she’s\n",

Well, maybe not *all* of it, but the rest of it.”  “Okay, well, I don’t know. I’m just going to check.”  “Okay.”  I walked into the bedroom.  The room was dimly illuminated by the light from the kitchen, and I could see the three of us sitting on the floor.

As it rose, the moonlight reflected off of the dark glass, and in that moment, I saw it.” He paused, as if he were considering the words, and then added, “I’m sorry.”  The man’s gaze wandered to the side of the room. “Weird, right?”  “Yeah, weird,” the man said. “But it’s just for a few seconds.”  “Did you see anything out of the ordinary?”  “No.”  “Did you hear a man crying?”  “No.”  “Then what?”  “I don’t know, man.

Let’s just talk about what we see out there.”  “No, man. Let’s just talk about the glass.”  “The glass!”  “Why do you think?”  “Because it’s the only thing we can see out there.”  “The man just said something else. It sounded like he was crying.”  “Oh,” the man said. “Oh.”  “I don’t know, man. I’ll just listen.”  “No, man. Let’s just talk about it.”  “The glass.”  “That’s a good sign.”  “Let’s just talk about it.”  “The man said something else. I’ll just listen.”  �\n",

He was too smart. Too good.   “If you don’t want me to go, then why not?”   “I don’t want to go,” he said. “Why? Because I’m ready for this.”   “I know that, son.”   “Well, I can do this for a lot less money.”   “No.”   “Then I’ll do it anyway.”   “I mean, you know I can do this.”   “Well, maybe I can’t do it for a lot less money, but I’m not ready for this.”   “Well, maybe that’s not such a bad thing, son.”   “Yeah, I guess so.”   “I guess I don’t know,” he said. “I’ll just do it, okay?”   “Yeah, okay.”   “Okay.”   “Okay.”   I finished the presentation and went to my room. I had a stressful day ahead of me, and I was better at talking to people than I was at business. So I went to my room.   When I woke up the next day, I realized I was still in my room. I went to the closet and pulled out a box of clothes. Then I went to the bedroom and pulled out a couple of pieces of jewelry.\n",

            "It started with an old granny and a young couple who got to know each other well, and a couple of friends from work. We didn't plan on going on this far, we just wanted to get out and see some old friends in person. It was a late August afternoon and we were out on the trails, having a late lunch, and we were just about to head back when the sun had already set and the sun was setting. We were heading back into the city when I noticed that the path back to our cars was getting really dark.   The path back was actually a very nice, normal, white stretch of road. We were about a minute out from where I remembered this, and we were just about to cross the threshold of a little yellow light that marked the intersection. There were no cars in sight. I figured that it was probably one of those old-school street lights that comes on and off whenever they're out. It never happened that I've ever seen one down here before, but I did notice a very large house, and I followed it.   A couple of minutes went by, and I looked around to try to find the friend who had just passed through, but he had already vanished into the dark. I thought for a second that he'd somehow gotten lost or something, but I kept going. I followed the house down the path, and it kept getting darker and darker until I couldn't see any lights.   I tried to keep my mind busy, and I started to go back to my car, but I didn't see any more of him or the light. I kept going, and the path got really dark.   I noticed that I was losing it. I tried to not think about this, but I couldn't. I started to get out of my car, and I walked up to the house. I hadn't noticed that he'd gotten lost or anything, but I heard him talking to himself.   \"Hey, hey, it's me, it's me, it's...\"   I stopped walking, and I tried to focus on the conversation going on in the house. I could hear the conversation that was going on in the hallway. I figured it was one of those old-school house lights that didn't go out, and I went back to following the conversation.   \"Hey, how are you?\"   \"I'm fine, just walking around, I guess.\n",

There was a man in his mid-thirties, middle-aged, and dressed in a hospital scrubs. He was having trouble breathing and looked pale. He was looking down at something, but I couldn't make it out.  I tried, but his eyes were too far away.   ““It’s a chest.”  I looked around.   He was lying in the middle of a pool of his own blood, looking up at the ceiling with a blank expression. His hands were bandaged up and he was holding something in his hands.  “What do you mean?”  “I mean a chest.”  “I’m sorry, but can you describe what?”  “I mean… I mean, it’s like a normal chest.”  “Okay, let’s try that.”  “Alright.”  “Okay.”  He looked at the ceiling again. “Well, I mean, it’s definitely a chest, but it’s… it’s a *w* chest, I guess.”  “I don’t know what you mean, but it’s bigger.”  “Well, maybe it’s a *w* chest?”  “I don’t know, man.

Then I looked over at her and said, “We have to get past this surface level of the truth, because the information we have is extremely valuable.”  “And you know that, right?”  “Yes,” she said. “I do. I’m the only one that does it for a living. I’m so grateful for you to do it for me.”  I gave her a smile. “Well, maybe that’s the case, maybe it isn’t.

            "I've been working with a group of students at my local community college for the last couple months. They come from a variety of backgrounds and ages, but typically all of them graduate with some sort of degree. For some reason, college seems to have a hard time attracting them. They come in all different shapes and sizes, but most all end up working towards some sort of degree. I've got a few students working towards master's degrees, and a few students working towards doctorates. There are a couple students that are working towards being a teacher, and a few students working towards becoming professors. This group of students is very diverse in background, and many of the students come from different parts of the country. This is great, because it allows me to target the students who have the most opportunity for success, and most of them have the least to lose.   I also have a very select few students who are working towards pursuing careers in academia. These students have to be students of my alma mater, because I only accept students with a degree from my school. This means that the students are from my community, and the professor has to approve of their academic standing. The students in my class have been working on this project for a while, and they are very enthusiastic about their choice of a professor.   I really appreciate the kind support this group of students has given me, and I am humbled by the kind words they have offered me. I can't tell you how many hours this has been motivating me. It has been an honor to teach these students, and I am grateful for the opportunity to meet them.   The final students are also very excited about their choice of a professor, and I am grateful for the opportunity to teach them.   So, that's why I'm writing this. I want to give you an update on the students working on their projects, as well as give you an update on the progress of the project.   The students have been working on their project for the last couple of weeks. I know this is very frustrating for you, but I will try to keep you updated.   I have a few students that have been busy, and I will update you soon with their progress. For now, I am going to share some of the progress that has been made.   1. The students have successfully implanted a microchip into the student body. This is very important for two reasons. The first reason is that the student body has to be constantly supplied with the same drugs, and the second reason is to prevent the student body from knowing that the drug they are injecting into the student body is a new and potent drug.   The student body is supplied with 5 milligram Roxicodone, and these students are successfully removing the need for this drug. This means that all of the students will be supplied with this drug daily, and should this drug become unavailable, the student body will be free from the necessity of this drug.   2. The remaining students have been successfully removing their implants. This means that all of the students are free from this drug.   This drug is a very potent and powerful drug, and the students have removed the need for this drug. If this drug becomes unavailable, the student body will be free from this drug.   The students have removed all of their internal organs, and are now free of the internal organs. This means that the student body is free from all of the internal organs. This also means that the student body has no longer needed the 5 mg of Roxicodone that was injected into it.   The student body is free from the need for external organs. This means that the student body will be free from all of the external organs.   The student body is free from the need for the 5 mg of Roxicodone.   3. The students are successfully removing all of the internal organs. This means that the student body is free from all of the internal organs. This also means that the student body no longer needs the 5 mg of Roxicodone that was injected into it.   This means that the student body is free from the need for the 5 mg of Roxicodone.   4. The remaining students have been successfully removing their implants. This means that the student body is free from the need for the 5 mg of Roxicodone. This also means that the student body no longer needs the 5 mg of Roxicodone that was injected into it.   This means that the student body is free from the need for external organs.   5. The student body is now free from the need for external organs. This means that the student body no longer requires the 5 mg of Roxicodone that was injected into it. This means that the student body is free from the need for this drug.   This means that the student body is now free from the need for external organs.   6. The student body is now free from the need\n",

I’m going to come back later, okay?”  “Okay.”  “Okay.”  I hung up. I sighed a little. “This has been going on for ten minutes, and I’m going to come back, okay?”  “Okay.”  I sat down on the couch.    I grabbed my keys and headed back into the house.    “Okay, you’re going to come back, okay?” I told her.  “Okay.”  “Okay.”  “Alright. I’m going to come back, okay?”  “Okay.”  “Okay. I’m going to come back.”  I hung up the phone. I went into the kitchen and grabbed my keys.    I walked into the kitchen. I went to the stove and started the grill.    I waited for a few minutes. I realized that there was someone sitting on the couch. I yelled at them to come out.    The person was looking at me, but didn’t move.    “Huh. What the hell is going on?”  “I don’t know, I don’t know.”  “Don’t you think someone is watching you?”  “Maybe someone is watching me, but…”  “What?”  “Don’t you hear me?”  “No, I don’t think so.”  “Okay, I don’t think anyone is watching.”  “Okay, okay. I mean, if it does, then it probably isn’t a bad thing.”  “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so.”  “Okay, okay. But if it doesn’t happen, then who knows what’s going on?”  “Well, I’ve been watching you for a while, okay? You don’t sound like you’re doing it on purpose.”  “I’m not.”  “I’m just…it’s weird. It’s weird.”  “It’s weird.”  “I mean, I don’t think anyone is watching you.”  “I mean, yeah. I mean, sure. That’s possible, yeah.”  “No. You know, if you go to the police, then you probably will. You’d be surprised what they can do for you,” I said.  “That’s not true. I’ve been saying that for a while.”  “Yeah, you know what?”  “It’s true. You could end up like me.”  “I don’t know. I don’t know.”  “I’d say against the odds, maybe. But that’s not a good thing.”  “It’s not a good thing for me either.”  “Oh, I know.”  “Well, I mean, do you think I’d be doing it?”  “Yeah.”  “Then who knows? You know who else they might be?”  “Maybe me,” I said. “I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is.”  “Well, what the hell are you talking about?”  “I don’t know.”  “And if it does happen, then?”  “I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe they will. I mean, what are you doing?”  “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know.”  “Okay.”  “I mean, I’m not sure.”  “Well, okay.”  “What?”  “No,\n",

            "I’d been at it for a while, but I’d never seen the hallway before.  But I had a friend who would come over to my place every week or so.  It wasn’t hard for me to convince him to come, especially after what happened last week.    The hallway was a long, white room.  It looked like a typical college dorm room, but there were three large beds, a kitchen, and a pair of stairs leading down to the basement.  I was the only one in the room with a camera, but I used one of those when I was working and had a hard time going back.    There was a black bag on the floor near the window.  It looked like a backpack, but there were no tools or appliances inside.  It was as if someone had torn all the stuff off the floor and tossed it into the room.  The bag looked heavy, but I didn’t think much of it.  I thought that the person could have been a student or some employee of the school.  I didn’t really think much of it, until I came back.    I was a little annoyed, so I grabbed one of the cameras and I set it up next to the door.  There was a lock on the door, and then a metal ring on the other side.  I knew that the person could have been a student or an employee of the school, but I didn’t think that much of it.  The other camera was pointed away from me, but I could see the hallway in front of me.  I thought that was odd, but I didn’t think anything too crazy happened that night.    The next day, I went into the office and told them about the bag.  They looked confused and asked me if I thought there was anything they could do, but I told them no and left.  The next day, I went to the same dorm as my friend and was completely alone.  I didn’t sleep at all, I just kept thinking about the bag and wondering if that was the person I’d seen on the black bag.  The thing is, I haven’t seen the hallway in a while, and I don’t know if that’s the person I saw on the black bag.    I went back to my dorm and found out that there was another student who lived in the same apartment complex as me.  He lived a few streets over from me.  He told me that he’d seen the same thing, but he hadn’t seen the person, so he couldn’t be sure.  He also said that there were other students living in the apartment complex, and that he didn’t know anyone who knew anything about it.    I asked him if he’d heard about it, but he didn’t know anything.  I asked him if he thought he was going crazy, but he said no.  He said he didn’t know anyone who knew anything about it.  He said he thought maybe someone had seen it happen before, and that he didn’t know who did it.    I told him to check his hallway again, and I left.    The next day, I went into the dorm and found out that there were only two other students living there.  The other student said that he heard the same thing.  He said he didn’t hear anything, but he thought he heard “oh my god!”  I asked him if he thought that was the person, but the other student said that he couldn’t confirm anything.    I asked him if he thought he could check the basement, but he said that it was too dangerous.  He said that he had to stay in the room with the lights off, and that he didn’t want to go down there alone.    I asked him if he thought he could talk to the owner of the apartment, but the other student said no.  He said he thought that was a good idea.  I left.    The next day, I went to the same apartment complex.  I came back to my dorm room after school and I just walked back to my dorm.  I walked back to my dorm and saw that my room was still empty.  There was a note on my door.  It said that I could find a roommate in the dorms.  I went to the dorms and asked my roommate if I could talk to him, but he said no.  He said he had a special project, and that he was going away on a weeklong vacation.  I asked him if he wanted me to come with him, but he said no.  I asked him if he wanted me to come with him, but he said\n",

When she saw me cry a few minutes ago, I don’t think she could have been happier.  She said she didn’t know how to help me, that she had to come to me for help.  She said she had to come to me for the first time.  That she was so scared, and I couldn’t do anything for her.  I couldn’t tell her to go back home, she had to learn how to be brave.        I felt the same.  I felt like a monster.  I hated myself for it, but I couldn’t help her.  I couldn’t give up on her.  I didn’t know how to help her, how to make her happy.  I couldn’t give up on her.  I just couldn’t.  And I told her we could do anything together.

            "A cyclist was killed after a freak accident involving a truck while riding on the SR-76 northbound near Brentwood. The driver of the truck was arrested, but the investigation revealed that the accident occurred because of the vehicle's unlicensed status. The cause of death was determined to be a massive heart attack caused by a massive brain hemorrhage.  The man was riding in the back seat. His name was Sean, and he was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.  The student was crossing the street when the crash occurred. The bus that was transporting him struck a patch of ice that was too small to pass under the vehicle. The driver of the bus, identified as Michael, jumped out and tried to avoid a wreck, but he crashed into the ice. The bus was towed to a nearby holding facility, and the driver was arrested. Michael's body was found on the ice, frozen to death.   The cause of death was determined to be massive heart failure caused by a massive brain hemorrhage.  Michael's body was found in a different part of the snow covered valley, in a different part of the winter, and his cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation due to hypoxia.    No one knows for sure what caused the crash, but it is very possible that the man was killed in the collision. The bus was still on the road and the driver was arrested, but the crash was reported to have occurred about a month after the crash.    The bus was towed, but the driver was never charged. The tow truck company refused to discuss the details of the case, and the driver was not provided with any medical records or any information about the case.     I have a good friend who works for the family, and he has a copy of the dashcam video of the night of the crash. He told me a few things that I need to share with you.     1. The man was not the one who struck the man.     2. The man who was riding in the back seat was driving, and he was driving down the snowy stretch of highway when he saw the man in the front seat of the bus. He stopped the bus, and he looked at the man for a second before getting out of the bus. He did not see the man in the rear view mirror.   3. The bus was full of college students. The man in the front seat was one of them. The man in the back seat was not.   4. The man who was driving the bus was not the one who struck the man in the back seat.   5. The man who was in the back seat was not the one who struck the man in the back seat.   6. The man who was in the back seat was not the one who struck the man in the back seat.   7.

I’m going to the cave.”  “I don’t want to die, I want to be hurt.”  “But I can help you.”  “Sure.”  “I’ll go with you.”  “I’m ready for anything.”  I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself in for, but I was prepared to go out with a willing stranger.  “I’ll go with you.”  “But…”  I hesitated, but then realized it wasn’t about going with me. I was getting myself into something much bigger.  “You can’t go alone.”  “But you don’t have to.”  “And you don’t have to tell me what you’re doing.”  “Sure, I can do that.”  “You don’t have to tell me anything.”  “But I want to know what you’re doing.”  “That sounds good.”  “I don’t know, but I guess I don’t know that much.”  “I can do that.”  “Great. Then we can talk.”  “Ok.”  The man smiled at me. “I don’t want you to die.”  “I mean, you know, that would be great.”  “We can talk.”  “But not about what.”  “We can talk about what we’ve been doing.”  “But that’s not it.”  “We can talk about anything.”  “Well…”  I felt a cold breeze on my face.  “What are you talking about?”  “Talking about anything.”  I looked at the ground.  “What is it?”  “Caveman.”  I was told not to mention it.  But now I did.   “I know it.”  I sighed. “I’m sorry, Dad.”  “Caveman, why?”  “Caveman, why?”  “Because you’re going to die.”  “No!”  “You’re not going to die!”  “I’m not.”  “Then stop talking about it.”  “I can’t.”  “I don’t understand.”  “Well…”  I stepped into the cave.  “Just stop talking about it.”  “What are you saying?”  “Stop talking about it.”  “If you don’t stop talking about it, then I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  “Stop talking about it!”  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  “What�\n",

It was a little girl’s voice, so soft and gentle that it almost made me feel like I was hearing a baby. “We’re gonna have to open the front door,” she said. “It’s the only way we can see our dead baby.”   “We’re gonna have to open the front door?” I asked. “How do you hear that?”   “Oh,” she said. “It sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “If you don’t knock, it doesn’t sound like someone knocking at all.”   “What?”   “But if you knock, you can hear it.”   “Sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “Who is knocking at the door?”   “No, it sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “Who is knocking at the door?”   “No, it sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “Who is knocking at the door?”   “No, it sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “But it sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “We are so afraid of the dark.”   “What do you mean?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “But we are so afraid of the dark.”   “What do you mean?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “What are you saying?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “Do you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “Do you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “How do you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “Why do you think it sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “But it sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “So what?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “And you hear that?”   “It sounds like someone is in there, knocking at the door.”   “But it sounds like someone is knocking at the door.”   “But someone is knocking at the door.”   “But someone is knocking at the door.”   “You can hear the sound, but you can’t see the sound?” \n",

I'd be up and running around the room, looking for a patient, and then I'd go to the patient's room and make a few comments about the day.  After a while, I started to notice a pattern. The rooms seemed to be all the same, but the patients seemed to be in a lot more pain. The same generic phrases I'd heard before, but now they were coming out more frequently.  \"What happened last night?\"  \"I'm feeling lightheaded.\"  \"What happened last night?\"  \"I woke up confused, but I noticed my eyes are all red.\"  \"What happened last night?\"  \"I woke up confused, but I noticed my heart rate is increased.\"  \"What happened last night?\"  \"I'm feeling lightheaded.\"  \"What happened last night?\"  \"I can't remember.\"  \"\n",

Don't worry about me, I won't be very much longer. Just be careful.\"  I nodded and we walked together to the next room.  The man looked up at me. \"You're back on track. Not exactly what you wanted.\"  I looked around the room, my mind reeling with confusion and fear.  \"So how did you know I was back on track?\"  \"I'm not allowed to talk about that. I don't know how you found me, and I'm not the only one either. But you need to start your routine now. I'm going to need you to stay in that room and try to remember that I'm here with you.\"  I nodded.  \"Now I can't stay there. I need to get some clothes for the room. If I'm going to get out, I'm going to need to get them from the closet in the room.\"  \"Okay. Well I'm going to go grab those.\"  \"No problem.\"  I grabbed my backpack and headed towards the closet in the room. I closed the door behind me and went back to my room.  I didn't sleep that night. I kept thinking about that strange man. And I kept thinking about the night before.   When I went to bed, I fell asleep around 4:00 a.m.  I was awake when I woke up.  I opened my eyes.  I was in my bed. I was wearing a nightgown. I was holding a large glass of water.   \"I'm so sorry, I just…\"  I felt my brain starting to shut down and my mind trying to process the information I just received.   \"What? How did I…\"  \"You woke up. How was I? What happened?\"  \"I woke up, you heard me talking. You need to listen to me.\"  I tried to ignore the fact that he was telling me this, but I could tell he was still trying to listen.  \"I need you to take a deep breath. Now. You have to take a deep breath and let it all out. I know what's going to happen, but it's best if you don't hear it.\"  He was trying to pull his thoughts and memories together when I was screaming and yelling.   \"Okay.\"  He was trying.   \"Now, you have to hold it. Now. You have to take a deep breath and let it all out. I know what's going to happen, but it's best if you don't hear it.\"  I tried to take a deep breath, but he stopped me.  \"I'm going to need you to go back to your room. After that, you can go back to sleep. Do you understand?\"  I nodded and he walked back to his room.   \"Okay.\"  He went back to his room and closed the door.   \"Now I need you to go back to your room. After that, you can go back to sleep. Do you understand?\"  I nodded.   \"Now I need you to listen to me. Do you understand?\"  I took a deep breath.   \"I need you to listen to me. Now. You have to listen to me. If you don't, you'll wake me up and I won't stop until you do.\"  I listened to him.   \"Okay.\"  He went back to his room and closed the door.   I heard a knock at the door and opened it.  \"Sir? Mr. Longbough?\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Listen, I need you to go to your room now. After that, you can go to sleep. I'll go into the bedroom once you do. Do you understand?\"  I nodded.   \"Okay.\"  I went back to my room.   After about an hour later, I heard footsteps in the hallway.  I went into the room.   \"Sir?\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Are you awake?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then why are you just now waking up?\"  \"I need you to stay on the phone with me. When you leave your room, stay on the phone with me.\"  I took a deep breath.   \"Okay.\"  I got out of bed and went into the kitchen.   I knocked on the door.   \"Sir?\"  \"Sir?\"  \"You can open the door. It's been a while since you last left this house, but you should be back by now.\"  \"I'm sorry, I'm not back yet.\"  \"I'll go into the bedroom, but don't be afraid. I'll go into the bedroom once you do.\"\n",

And I need you to tell me when she comes back.”  “I’ll do it,” I said. “I’m not letting you walk down that dark road alone.”  “What do you mean?”  “I mean, you need to tell me when she comes back.”  “Then I’ll do it,” I said. “I’ll always tell you when you’re ready.”  “Okay,” she said. “We will.”  I sighed a bit. “She has been...”  “She’s been gone for so long.

I had seen the person leaving the trail of the crime scene, and had followed it into the dark.     I told the staff about my wife, and how she had been an avid reader of the local newspaper. She had been a little suspicious about me, but not as much as I thought.     I told them about the weird things I had noticed while I was out in the woods. I had seen a man in a dark hoodie and jeans. I had seen a man going around in a tree. I had even seen the man getting on his hands and knees, reaching into the dark woods.

I don’t know how to prove it, but I thought you might.”  “But you can’t prove it.”  “Well, it’s not a question, it’s an invitation.”  I leaned forward and kissed him on the forehead. “I’m sorry, but that’s not a question.”  I kissed him a few more times before I said, “I think you should meet the other woman.”  “Okay.”  “And what’s your name?”  “Anja.”  “I’m sorry, I think.”  “And you’re with the other woman?”  “Um…”  “There,” I said. “I can prove that.”  “But that’s a…”  “I’m sorry, but that’s a question.”  “I’m glad,” I said. “I’m glad you’re here.”  I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet, completely naked.  “You can go home, you know, I’m not exactly what you think of when you’re thinking about sex, but I’m sure you have other things on your mind, and I think that you’re in the right, if you want to talk about this.”  I pulled out my phone and texted Anja. “I don’t know how to prove this.”  “Well, maybe you’re not right.”  “How can I prove that?”  “Well, you’re right, but I don’t think that’s the only way.”  I hung up and texted her. “Wait a minute. What?”  “You don’t think that you’re right?”  “I don’t think that’s the only way.”  “Well, maybe you are.”  “Okay.”  I texted her again. “Anja, I’m sorry to hear about the other woman. I know I should talk to you more, but I don’t know how to prove that it’s the only way.”  “Okay, I’ll talk to you later. But for right now, I need you to think about this.”  I paused as I thought about what I had just said. “I need you to think about it.”  “Okay,” I said.  “And if you think about it, why is it so hard for you to go back to your life as you were? Why don’t you go back to your normal self, your happy self, the person you used to know you would never go back to? Why do you think you keep playing the same video game?”  “I don’t know.”  “Well, it’s not the only way. If you think about it, it’s not even the same game. If you go back to it, you’re going to keep playing the same video game over and over. It’s not that hard to keep playing it, and besides, I don’t think that’s the only way.”  “And you’re saying that if I go back to my normal self, the person I used to be, the person I used to love, the person I used to know, it’s not that hard to keep playing the same video game over and over.”  “I know, I know, it\n",

            "I’m the only one that thinks I’m doing it wrong. I’m the only one that thinks it’s a lie. The only one that doesn’t believe me.  I want you to know I’m not fucking around. I’m not trying to be a good guy; I mean, I have friends in high places, and I know how it is to be selfish.  You see, in my opinion, the whole “honeymoon period” is the exact same thing as the whole “date night” in the beginning. You know? You’d think it was the most obvious.  But it isn’t.  I’m the only one to tell you that. And I’m the only one to understand what I’m saying.    And I’m the only one who can convince you.  And I’m the only one to be brave enough to ask me to do something that I can’t do for myself.   So I’ll tell you.   The date night.   I was in a movie theater, and I felt the same way you did. I was bored. I was a bit on the chubby side, and I had my hand over my heart. But it was a movie, so I felt okay. I felt normal.   I walked out of the theater, and walked into the dark, neon theater.    I was so drunk that I didn’t even notice the guy next to me. He was very tall, and his hair was very short. But he had a very distinct pattern. His pants were black, and his shoes were white. He was dressed in an old, old-school, red and gold tie. He was very intimidating.    I walked up to the man. He was very red in the face, and he had that look of fear. Like he was afraid of me, or at least that’s how I felt.   “Hello, I’m the only one here,” I said.   He tried to hide his fear.  “I’m not here with you,” he said. “I’m alone here.”   I was so afraid that I could hardly speak.  “You aren’t alone here, are you?”  “I don’t think so,” he said. “I think there are others here.”  “I’m not sure I can see anyone else,” I said.  “Yeah, I think so.”  “You’re not wearing a seatbelt, are you?”  “Yes, I think so.”  “I know, and I’m not going to get you into trouble,” I said. “I just don’t want to lose you.”  “I know, okay.”  “So I’ll just make it clear that you are the only one here. And I’m the only one who can help you. You are the only one who can make a difference. You are the only one who can save your friends.”  “I don’t want to lose you,” I said. “I’m sorry, I don’t want to lose you.”  “I know, I know.”  “Now, if you get any ideas on how to make a better date, I’ll be more than happy to help.”  He looked at me in confusion. “What’s wrong?”  I blushed.  “Maybe you should just go home and sleep on the couch, ok?”  I took a deep breath and looked out the window.    He rolled his eyes. “Hell, I’d never leave you.”  I felt like I was falling asleep, but I couldn’t. I kept thinking about how he was the only one here. And I felt like I was making the right decision. I left the theater and went back to my place.   I got a couple of beers and started preparing myself for the night. I went to my room and settled in.   I felt an odd sense of unease creeping into my body. I could feel it. Like I was seeing ghosts or something. But I could also feel it. Like I was in a strange dream.   I felt it again the next day.    I was at my house, and I was sitting on the couch, drinking a beer. I couldn’t see anyone, but I\n",

            "I've gone to every possible length to try and figure out what happened. The only way I know of that works is by using all the evidence I've got. My understanding of the case is minimal at best, but I'm working hard to make sure I don't let that get in the way of my work.   I started at the police station, of all places. I sat down with the detective assigned to the case, a guy who I think is fairly well known in the community. He was really nice, and helped me process everything. He even had me sign the official police report. I really appreciate that.   Now, you have to understand, a lot of the information in this case is very old. I have to give you some background on this guy. He's not a police officer, but he is a private detective who has worked on a few other cases in the past. In fact, he's one of the few private detectives in the country that is not a part of the regular force. This means he can't be sued, and he's restricted to certain areas of the city. I won't bore you with a detailed description of what he's done, but basically he's been investigating this case for years, and his findings have always been... inconclusive.   The most recent development was a search of his apartment this past summer. He called in some friends to help him with a back-up plan, and one of the friends he called is the detective assigned to the case. So, yeah, this guy is a private detective working in a court-ordered manner.   As far as I know, the case is closed. This means the detective is no longer looking into the case, and the detective is no longer in any way connected with the case. The detective is now out of the office, and I have no reason to believe anything has happened after he left.   I also asked the detective about the 'dirt trail' he's been using to connect the dots. He said he was using 'heavy equipment' to dig up some old property, and that he's decided to stop looking into it.   But the detective just told me he'll continue looking into it. He told me I should expect a 'media advisory' in the next couple days.    And now for the 'what if it's true?' portion of the case.   I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with how this all played out. I felt like a giant fish out of water, and was completely baffled as to how this could possibly have happened. There were so many suspicious leads, but nothing more. All I know is, I tried to find as much as possible and pursued every lead as much as I could.   It started small. I contacted the local school district, the local newspapers, and the local newspaper chains. As far as I could find, there was no news articles about this case in the mainstream media. So, I searched the local blogs for any interesting or interesting updates. I also contacted the local police departments, and as far as I know the detectives assigned to the case are no longer investigating it.   I also contacted the city's public defender, who told me their office wouldn't be pursuing any leads. I asked if they would be offering any information to the public, and as far as I know, they haven't had any public statements regarding the case.   As for me... I'm going to continue searching.

            "Weird thing to say about this. My wife and I both work in the same building, so we always have to cross-dress in public. But there was a woman in our building who always wore her hair in a bumble bee style, and in her bra and panties. I thought it was pretty at first, and I tried to be nice to her, but then I noticed that she was staring at me, and she was talking to someone. Her hair was wet, and I thought maybe she was talking to me, but it looked like she was talking to a man. I tried to talk to her, but no one could hear me. I figured that's weird, but I just assumed that she was talking to someone else.  My wife and I decided to go into our building's security system to try and catch her. I didn't think it was that easy, because this was the same woman who always spoke to me in the dark. She was also always in her bra and panties when I went to the bathroom, which was weird because I always thought it was a good idea to always wear my underwear. But one time, I went to the bathroom and she was standing there, barefoot, and talking to someone. I thought maybe she was talking to a man, but she was talking to someone else.  I walked back to my car, and as I was going to go back to my car, I noticed she was still in her bra and panties. But now she was looking at me. I backed out of the parking lot, and when I got home, I called her a man and told her that I didn't know who she was talking to. I gave her my phone number, but she said she didn't want to talk to me.   Now I have a weird fetish for her bra and panties. I would go into the bathroom and see her wearing her bra and panties when I went to the bathroom, and I would look in for hours. I don't know why she would lie about her bra and panties being wet. Maybe she just didn't like me touching them or something.   My wife is really kind to me. She treats me like a queen. She would always make me sit on the toilet when I had to pee. She would always give me money to use when I needed it. She would always make me shower when I went to the bathroom. She would always take me shopping when I had to be at home. She would always make me clean up after myself. I thought it was a good idea to pay her a visit when she was out of town, but then again she was just so nice. I felt bad for her when I told her I wanted to talk to her. She was just so nice. I felt bad for not being able to just go out there and make it happen.   I decided to tell my wife about this. I called her a few days later and told her about this. She was just so happy, and she said she was going to talk to the police. I asked her if she was going to talk to me when she got home. She said she would talk to me when she got home. I was so happy.   I told my wife about this, and she told me to go check on my wife a few days before. I said I would do it when I got home. She hung up on me when I called her. I tried calling the police, but no one picked up. I decided to wait until I got home, and then I could talk to my wife.   I called my wife and told her about what I had done. She said that she was going to talk to me when I got home, and I could talk to my wife. I told her to text me the number, and then I would call her. I told her that I would text her when I got home.   About an hour later, my wife texted me that my sister was in the bathroom. I had to go to the bathroom, so I just sat in the living room while my wife cleaned the kitchen.   I told my wife to call me when she came home. When I got home, I walked into my wife's room and closed the bathroom door. I was so happy. I told my wife that I had just told her that my sister was in the bathroom, and she was so happy. I told her to go get the groceries and then come back.   As I was getting ready to go, I noticed that my wife was sitting on the bed, and I could see her breasts bouncing around. I tried to ignore this, because I wanted to be with my wife. But then I noticed that my wife was looking down at the floor, and she had her hands up, like she was trying to calm down. I couldn't help but notice that she was smiling.   I texted my wife again. I told her that I was going to talk to her when I got home, and\n",

            "’s the first thing you notice about a ghost. I don’t know what to call him. Maybe a ghost? A ghost? No, what’s he supposed to be?  I start fumbling through the pocket, but I find the ghost’s name. It’s just a string of characters.  “This’s not a ghost,” I say. “This is a picture of a man.”  I look at the picture. “It’s a picture of a man.”  He sits back down. “This is the picture of the man that lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  I don’t know how to describe this guy. He doesn’t have any friends. He’s got no friends.  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  I don’t know how to describe this guy. He doesn’t have any friends. He’s got no friends. He’s got a ghost who’s scared of the man in the house. He’s scared of the man who lived in the house. He’s scared of the man who lived in the house.  I stop fumbling around and stare out the window. I hear footsteps behind me. I hear the footsteps. I hear the ghost.  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  “He lived in the house.”  I don’t know how to describe this guy. He doesn’t have any friends. He doesn’t have a ghost. He just has this ghost who lives in the house. He lives in the house. He lives in the house. And he doesn’t know who he is, but he knows this guy. I’m not gonna tell you who he is. I think you’ll know more. I think you’ll understand.  I walk back to my car and take off. I hear footsteps behind me. I hear the ghost. I hear the man who lived in the house. And I hear this ghost who lives in the house. And he’s scared of the ghost in the house.  I turn the car around and I drive back to my apartment. I walk down the hallway and I start yelling. “What’s happening?”  I walk down the hallway. I start yelling. “What the hell is going on?”  I turn on the television.  The TV is on.  The ghost is sitting on the bed. The man is sitting in the chair opposite the bed.  “I’m not a ghost. I’m a man.”  “What the fuck is happening?”  “I’m your... your ghost.”  “I don’t know how you know that, but you have to see it.”  “It’s your ghost.”  I dial the number.  “Listen, I need you to talk to me.”  “What do I mean?”  “I don’t know how you know that. I need you to tell me about yourself.”  “I don’t know how you know that. I can hear your voice.”  “That’s fine. Tell me if you see anything.”  I dial the number.  “I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “I don’t know how you know that, but you have to tell me.”  “I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “And I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “And I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “And I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “And I need you to tell me if you see anything.”  “And\n",

            "I had been driving home from the gym when my sister Annalise suddenly appeared in the middle of the road.  She was wearing her summer dress and was talking to a man who was also talking to a man. I started talking to her about the strange situation we were in and her boyfriend, James.  “Hey, is this your boyfriend?”  “Yeah.”  “What’s his name?”  “Tommy Taffy.”  “Ok, I see,” I muttered, taking off my earbuds and looking down at my phone.   “Tommy Taffy?”  “Oh, ok.”  “Ok, I’m sorry, his name is Tommy Taffy.”  “Oh. Ok, ok.”  “Ok, I see.”  “Oh. Ok.”  “Ok, so, are you friends with Tommy Taffy?”  “Yeah.”  “How old are you?”  “About eighteen.”  “Ok, well, you were in the midwest. What’s your address?”  “My address is…”  “Where are you from?”  “Uh, I live in Phoenix, Arizona.”  “Ok, ok.

            "”She’s beautiful.””  I smiled, and offered her a hand up to hug her. “I don’t know how she knows that.”  She took my hand in hers. “I don’t know how.”  “You can’t blame her.” I took her hands in mine. “I’m sorry, but that’s a bad word, and I don’t think you understand what it means.”  “I know,” she said. “You’re not sorry.”  “I think you should apologize to the dog.”  I took her hands in mine again, but this time I asked her to hold her for a bit. She did, and then the two of us went back to talking.  After that, we talked about the future. I told her about the old man, and how he told me that he would pay her a visit in a couple days. I told her that I would go with him to the train station, and then we both went home.  The next day, she got a call. “That guy didn’t show up today, so I’m really worried.”  “Maybe he’s still there,” I said. “Or maybe he left.”  “Maybe he left too late.”  “Or maybe he killed himself.”  She told me that she was going to go over there, but she was going to take a different route than I did.  “Do you want to go?”  “Yeah. I’m not afraid.”  “I can help you.”  “Sounds good.”  “Great.”  “Good.”  She called me a few days later. “It’s really lonely out there, you know?”  “Can I go with you?”  “No.”  “Then I guess you can”.  “No, I don’t think so.”  “It’s fine, but don’t tell anyone. I don’t think it’s a good idea.”  “Well maybe if you don’t tell anyone, that’s fine,” I said. “I’m not going anywhere.”  “Then I guess you can’t tell anyone.”  “Well, I guess that’s not really true,” I said. “It’s not like you’d really know if the guy was really dead or not, anyway.”  “Are you going to leave me?”  “I don’t think so.”  “Then what?”  “Then you can’t really tell anyone. I mean, it’s not like you’re not going anywhere anyway.”  “Oh,” I said. “No, I think that’s a fair statement.”  “Fair?”  “Yes.”  “Alright,” I said, but I wasn’t really thinking about anything at all.  I was just thinking about how much this game sucked.  “Alright,” I said. “I think I’ll do it.”  She called me the next day. “Oh, I’m sorry. I know this is a little weird.”  “But you need to make it worth your while. If you don’t do it, you’ll die. And there’s no way you’re going back.”  “Alright. Fine. I guess I’ll do it.”  I hung up and went on with my life.  I talked to my mom for a bit, who told me she would go back to work after school, and then I hung up and went home.  I went back to the game and tried to solve as many pieces of this puzzle as I could.  I had a good week. I hung out with my friends, played video games, and I even made a few new friends.  It wasn’t easy.  There were a few people that I was really close to, and they all seemed to be really into me.  But I was really alone, and I hadn’t seen anyone since I went back to my house.  I felt lonely, and I was lonely.  It was the middle of August, so I\n",

            "The other day, I came home to find a box on the floor of my living room. It was wrapped in a piece of butcher paper. There was a note on the top that read “Have a nice day.”  I picked it up and opened it up.  “Here you go, sweety.”  Inside the box was a bag of frozen treats. I froze to my feet.  “There’s only one more box” I said, dragging the box over to my bedroom. “You gotta help me get this one off my dead body”  The note fell off of the bag, the rest of the contents of the box vanishing into the snow.  “What the hell?” I said. “I never keep anything on my dead body.”  “Yeah, but it’s all in boxes, you know, ‘stash’s not supposed to be a thing,’” she said, pulling the box out and holding it in front of me. “And the note said, ‘Don’t leave it unattended, now is the best time to leave it.’’”  “That’s the only reason I left it there, huh?” I said, holding the bag in my hands. “It’s the only reason you got it on your dead body”  “Hey, I’m not gonna leave a dead body on my dead body.”  “If you think dead bodies are for decoration, you’re totally wrong. They are an integral part of the body. You’re not even finished with your body’s decorations yet,” she laughed.  “Then what the fuck are you doing, creep?” I yelled at her. “I can’t just leave a dead body on my dead body.”  She laughed again. “You can’t, sweety, and you don’t know the whole story.”  “I don’t know what you are, I just think you should know,” I said. “In case you don’t believe me, I have a friend who goes by the name of Hell. He’s been a bodyguard for a while, and he’s actually a Buddhist. He lives in a monastery somewhere in the Himalayans, and he claims to have visited a number of dead bodies, but he hasn’t told me who, or why. I mean, I think it’s pretty clear that if you walk into Hell, you get sent straight into the fire, so why the Hell not let someone go straight to the fire?”  She nodded and said, “I think he’s the best friend you can have there, and I think that Hell is a pretty big deal.”  “So, I don’t see how it could be a bad thing for you to come see.” I asked, thinking back over all of my previous experiences with the police. “I mean, yeah, it could be, but it could also mean death.”  She smiled and said, “Would you like to get out of here?”  “I don’t think so.”  “Then what the fuck are you waiting for?”  “You know why I asked you to come see me?” I asked. “Because you’re the only one that knows where I am, and the only one that can see me.”  She nodded. “Yes.”  I looked around. “Ok, well, maybe that’s not entirely true, but you have no proof. You have no witnesses, and you don’t even have a map.”  She nodded to herself, and walked away.  “So, what the hell is going on?” I asked. “I mean, I do have some, er, anecdotes about Hell, but they’re all just stories. And I’m not sure I want to take the chance of them all being true, and it could all just be superstition.”  “I’m not telling you to leave.” She said. “I’m telling you to be careful.”  I watched her go. I wanted to say something to her, but I was scared that she’d hurt me or just outright told me to leave, but I didn’t. I kept listening to my mother.  “Do you think it’s a bad thing for you to stay in Hell?” I asked. “Do you think it\n",

            " only just an empty apology.  He stood there with his head in his hands, eyes narrowed, as if observing someone. The other was back inside, and I heard a faint, muffled conversation in the background.   \"He did it, right?\" The boy said. \"You know why? Because if you weren't, I wouldn't have had to pull the plug.\"  I nodded and turned back to the man. \"I don't know. Did he say something to you?\" He asked. \"Did he tell you?\" I nodded. \"No he didn't.\" \"Oh?\" He shrugged. \"That's good.\"  I sat down next to the other one. \"So why did you pull the plug?\"  He shrugged again. \"What do you know?\"  \"Have you never heard of the *clown-clown*?\" He laughed.  \"Why?\"  \"The game,\" he said. \"It's called Clown and Clunker.\"  \"What game?\"  \"The ‘Clown-Clunker’,\" the boy said. \"It has four legs. There are four forms it can take, and those four are called Clowns. One form kills, one takes the form of another, and one takes the form of a clunker again.\" He laughed again. \"Everyone has a Clown, but the Clunker kills the clown. Everyone has got to be careful. That's the rules.\"  I didn't finish talking to him. After that we didn't speak for hours.  In the morning I had to sleep through the night. I tried calling out for help and he yelled up to the ceiling for help but he was nowhere to be seen. I heard the kids playing in the outside yard and thought it was just one of them playing, but I walked down the steps and a man went in front of his house and sat down on the lawn. He didn't open his door but the neighbor found him and took him away. Soon enough I was lying on the lawn, watching a man who looked about my age in a yellow robe come up behind me. I thought he might be one of the other boys, or another parents but I wasn't worried about them. They were never out late. Finally, I woke up and headed into the barn to eat some more of the hay.  There was a big line of women waiting to be let through to the field to come pick up their kids, and one of those women was the mother of two murdered girls who were buried in their own body bags in the coffin. I sat down with one of the other mothers and one of the dead girls' fathers. \"It's a bad idea. Kids are too vulnerable and it's dangerous.\"  The father looked up when I started talking. \"That makes a lot of sense. Why?\"  \"It's dangerous.\"  \"And we'd better watch our women.\"  That's when I heard a crunching of hay behind me and I turned around to see the mother of the two girls behind me on the other side of the farm. She ran up to us and said, \"He's gone back there.\"  \"Yeah, he was gone.\" The two parents watched in horror as the mother got up to help clean up the graves and the father stayed in the barn staring out into the fields.  \"That's our worst fear,\" I told the parents.  \"She called that. Someone's trying to hurt him.\"  The mother tried to not scream as she went by the dead girl's body. She said she called it, and then the blood from her husband's body pooled in the bags over the dead girl's neck. She said she told me what she saw while she was trying to call the police and then I ran out to tell the parents.  They are a family who has a very close relationship with the police and they told me there's no way anyone is home. But they are the gatekeepers to the community and the police are the gatekeepers to God Himself.  I just got in a plane ticket home and everything is fine.  My only other questions are...who was this man the two girls talked about and what was his name? and was he still a parent? I don't know anything. People that I know have worked here say it sounds like he may have had a daughter. They don't know if the girl he killed was their daughter. I contacted the police, they said they're looking into it. I'm so scared right now. I don't know if he's still alive or not.  *Update*: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y9v9v/one_of_my_employees_has_been_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8/  Hi again guys!

            " every night, when I looked up to him, I saw just the slightest outline of him.  For the rest of the night we hung out in the kitchen talking, laughing about how good we were; about the good ol' days when girls would go into the house and be happy, and be able to sleep with their boyfriends around...even.   That night, I kept him company. I don’t think he would have wanted us, because it was really hot. We both had longs with our boyfriends, so we were even going to talk to him during the day. But then it did rain. We were both getting really high, so when the wind stopped, we were both able to sleep for a while.  The next day, I asked the girl if she would mind if I went inside.  “Sure,” she said, “but I don’t want to stay here. I really want to stay in our place, with the flowers...”   She got visibly uncomfortable and I heard her mumble something about “dying for a dead boy”.  “We don’t care if he dies a long time. What do you mean? There’s lots of girls who want to stay in the house!” I said excitedly. Even though she was probably the last girl I would date, at least I didn’t think so. “Look, she’s probably just jealous. I’m here, and you’re still out here, and it’s okay to talk. It’ll be fine!” I could see the unease in the girl again.  But then, the next morning, she was gone.  I was just as creeped out and disturbed as she was, but I did my best to keep her in the conversation. I was texting her, telling her how much we missed her, how much she loved me. So when we got some time to talk as usual, I asked what she was doing and what she was looking at. And as I started to ask more questions, she just walked away.  “You did good,” I said, with a wince. This girl, she was strange, right? I knew she was. But I never thought it was coming to a head. I’d never really thought someone would actually do something like that.  So I had to find a new girl for her. It became apparent that my best bet was to contact her through Grindr or some app on the phone. I’m a gay man, so my heterosexual friends were aware of how weird I was being. This would make her realize that she was being thought of as an odd guy, and would convince her to go back to us.   And I was able to do that in about 30 minutes. I was able to start to talk to her again the next day. I was asking her questions about life as a hooker, what she did when she wasn’t home, and stuff like that. She just shook her head, and said, “I don’t want to make it a habit.” This conversation seemed pretty innocuous, so I couldn’t be sure what her real motives were. But I wasn’t going to waste my time on this. I was going to track her down so that I could talk with her again.  So I started walking her. She wouldn’t stop walking. Eventually, we came to this intersection and I parked my car. I was expecting to see a car stop and get out of there, so we walked around the corner and it was empty.  But I was expecting more walk. She kept walking. I was expecting her to make her first cut. But she kept walking. I was expecting her to leave her car until we were both inside. And she didn’t leave the intersection. So I decided that we needed to check this girl before we brought her inside.  I pulled out my phone and started sending these messages to this girl's Grindr account. This girl hadn’t left her car. She was standing at the opposite curb of the intersection. Her door was still locked, but she stood at the edge of the sidewalk. I was expecting her to go to the car and get out of there. But she didn’t. I was expecting her to climb in from behind the car and crawl all the way to the end. But she didn’t crawl. She crawled from the car all the way to the car, looking around with wide eyes. Then she walked all the way to the end, looking down at the parking lot. The spot between the car and parking structure was a certain extent of the sidewalk. I didn’t think it was a good shot, especially since this woman had probably just parked somewhere out of the block. But what I was most\n",

            ". I was starting to panic.\"  \"There must be something in the water!\" I exclaimed. \"There's something in the water!\"  \"No, it's just been eaten,\" I said. \"I saw it too, in the cave.\"  I heard him walking away, and I started to panic. I grabbed my purse and walked out of the house. The house was in a cul-de-sac, so I couldn't see much, but I saw him walking around for a few minutes before I heard him come down through the house. \"I was hoping you'd come look at this!\" He said.   I shook my head to clear it, and I started to back away. \"No, you should really investigate this yourself,\" I said. \"I've been searching for weeks now and I haven't found anything. Don't you get it? He's just playing a prank on me!\"  He went on. \"[I'll explain.]\" he replied, smiling. \"I can't believe there's not much more to the story.\"   As I said, there's no way this guy could have anything to do with the missing girl. He was supposed to be the one who found her, and his name wasn't even on the report! It's like his head was in a cast and the whole thing was a joke. I guess the worst part was that he didn't even do anything. Well, he went down the cul-de-sac and didn't go back up. No one knows how he got there, and maybe someone saw him cross and followed him all the way back.   Here's a picture of the guy I found at The Lake. He looked just like the guy who was found in that lake. I don't want to go into any more detail, but I have a close friend who says we should go to the coroner and have him look at the body. It'd be awesome if he'd take a look at this dead body. (Sorry if this spoils your weekend). I was the one who found his body, so I guess he couldn't go to the coroner, either.   I'll tell you more about this after tomorrow, okay? Have a good weekend, everyone. See you in the coming days!  &#x200B;  EDIT: Submissions have opened.

I'm a little behind on the computer but I'm slowly coming back into the loop. I just got back from my friend's wedding and I figured it would be a good idea to post up the last part of my story. After all, there are several things to keep in mind if you're reading this. A lot of you have been asking us about this story and I have some important messages I'd like to send to you.   Since I don't know who you can contact for this story, I'm going to be putting this on the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NoSleepHearst) so as not to throw any extra weight around on my shoulders. I'll be updating with full details as soon as I have them. To answer your question about my side and to get as many of you as possible involved in this, I have been following the same story. I am so sorry it is taking so long. I have tried to answer as many of your questions as possible.  **This is a red herring. I swear I never followed the streamers any further, and any further questions about them I would be banned.**  So I've been following this story for over a week now, but I can finally post it up.  It might surprise some of you. There is a picture of my side. My side! It seems like I was staring right back at my side when I got the message.  I'm honestly not sure what to think. This is something I can get a hold of for at least a couple of days now. I have to admit I was very tempted. But\n",

            " were, the only thing I could think to sleep through for two months straight.  It wasn’t so bad in the first couple of months, but then I figured it out.  I figured it was cancer.  It was called neuro- oncology and there were a lot of weirdos out there who were either completely fucking against it, or were completely fucking with it with their money. And some of them were actively trying to murder me so some other family would get a piece of me from my ass.  It would be some strange, even grotesque, nightmare.  I wasn’t much of a romantic and I tried not to be, but I definitely felt like a ghost in my own home.  I couldn’t stop thinking about how there weren’t any other doors or windows until it was safe to do this, but all I could see were those glowing things and all the cameras in the house.  I looked around the room until I found it empty except for a single door.  I walked around the whole house and I could see that there were cameras everywhere, and that it was all for some sort of movie I’d been watching.  I’ve watched movies over the years and never once in a movie did we ever find a person’s body.  I don’t know.  I mean, it was creepy to think about.  I walked out of the house.  I’m writing this to you, because I feel like I am in my own personal Hell.  I don’t know what else to do.  But I’ve done this to myself.  And it’s time to go to sleep.  I can't go back in, and there’s no way I’m ever leaving this place, but I love you too much. [PS: Let’s hope this is the last one.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)I am the luckiest human being in the history of the world.   A year ago, I had to undergo a major operation on my stomach. It was a procedure to save my life- but it cost a lot of money, and for the remaining year, I spent being on the shelf in my room.   This week, I was in my hospital bed, looking down on all this happen, when I felt an idea that was so obvious to me that it was almost miraculous.    Maybe I shouldn't be surprised that I didn't go into my computer until I was able to use my index finger.   But I was convinced that it was all for some kind of horror movie; I had forgotten my keycard while taking too long to walk around the living room to my room, and no amount of money would allow me to leave the house without that in tow.   I figured I could just get behind the locked door? *Probably* would be the best option.   I could watch the movies till the hospital was done with them? *Probably* that would be the better option.   I could go back to school and study? Then I might be able to figure out what to do about the whole situation.   But then I thought about that guy at the office. He had clearly been in my house for quite some time.   *Damn it.* If only I’d remembered my keycard during the robbery…   That night, I didn’t.   I had forgotten it.   I really didn’t even know what it was.    “So, I’ll drive all the way to you,” the phone call announcer announced.   “What’s my call sign?”   “Oh, nothing.  It’s a text only system.  Sorry, there’d be some trouble, but…”   Before I could finish speaking, the guy on the other end said something that had me frozen, listening to what it was saying over the line.   “So you got your keys from a lost or used car?”   “Yeah.  Your old car.  You can’t believe he’s still out there.  That’s your ride?”   “Yeah, I think so.  I’m not going to get involved with this shit myself, but if it’s not safe, I’m not gonna…”   The guy cut the line off.  “Well, at least you haven’t forgotten about it.  Anyway, this is the last call you’ll ever ever get from us.  I don’t plan on continuing with today’s program.  You stay there.”   He hung up.  \n",

            " just get a little older, I think, and it would never be any more. But, I don't know. I still don't know what happens when you don't want to be a parent.  **AS:** I know what happens. I know what’s not going to happen.  I tell her to turn around.  **AS:** I don't want to be a parent.  She doesn't say anything. My heart races. She’s too nice, too caring. I can almost imagine her in that moment, so close to me, telling me that I’m *not* going to have to be a parent. I feel bad for breaking her heart, but it seems like a small price to pay in order to salvage what we’ve all worked for this entire season. She’s been my best friend for quite a long time, and it would mean the world to her if she left just this one job and became a parent. However, I just can't shake the feeling that that’s exactly what she wants.  I don't know what she’s saying. I can't quite listen in on what she’s saying, but she’s saying “I don't want to be a parent” in exactly the same breath as she’s saying “I don't want to be a parent”. I feel like something inside me is really stirring, and I can't let it happen. I know I can’t help but feel that something is about to happen. I feel like I’m really going to end up with a lot of new things, but I also know it won’t be a mess like what happened yesterday. If anything, things will be much better that way. I don’t *want* to do that, but the choice isn't right now.  What should we do with her?  **AS:** I want to make sure that she's taking care of herself before she hits the ground running.  **VOICE:** You’re the captain. You’re the one directing the recovery. You should be back before ten tomorrow morning. You can arrange for a cab to come pick you up at the airport if you would like.  So now we wait. What should we do?  I think the *worst* thing that could happen to us is to let this woman walk free.  I think they all want to do something terrible, and we just can’t stop the worst thing.  What about the second interview?  I think they can’t let her walk free and just keep on doing what she's done to us.I grew up in rural Minnesota before moving into the city five years ago. It was a small town with just over 3,200 people and quickly gained population density. A few years back, we were one of the first communities in the region to introduce automated voting. It made sense; after all, people tend to cluster around in geographically isolated places and highly concentrated population centers are an obvious prime target.   The thing is, our town was also one of the first built on a tall, sloped hill. Looking at census data from the 70s, it was clear that a hill top would be ideal for residential development. A few houses had been laid out and given a little paint, the rest hidden behind stone walls and fences. I remember being somewhat envious of other towns for the easy access to high rise construction sites in places, but despite the fact we had long since filled up all the empty lots on four sides and nearly a foot of land, we were still considered part of a very dense, densely populated area.   I guess being the first in a long time to grow up in a large city meant being a bit picky about which buildings belonged to which street. After all, we didn't own any real estate of our own, and the neighborhood had grown very close to ours. But we never built anything big, and since we only had limited commercial realty for the area we were in, we never really developed any houses of our own.   That changed in May 2013, when a strange phenomenon was observed on our street. While most of the neighbors had just about finished shoveling dirt, a white hot empy like heat from a car starting coming through the door. The town was taken over by a strange heat, like you'd expect to see when your stomach starts churning.    I can't prove it with any scientific methods, but I have a strong feeling I had never seen anything like it before. Not only was it unusual to see something like it, but it was freak inducing. I mean, we lived in a small town, and it definitely seemed like something out of the ordinary was going on. My sister and I were at the time living in our family’s bungalow when it happened. I was the only girl\n",

            " you’re going to help you do it. You have to do it *now*, before something happens.”       “What is it, anyway?” I said, my eyes growing wide.       “I have to talk to you, baby.”        “How?”        “You have to…I mean…you have to tell me what’s going on.”         “I know what’s going on.”         “Do it then.”         I nodded eagerly, my arms already stretched to accommodate the heaviness of the burden. The man in the corner leaned forward, his smile still plastered on his face. He leaned on his daughter as well, all the strength in his body cranked out of his limbs.          My legs shook as the two of us made our way across the grassy verge. Through the dust, the light from my flashlight shone through our twine and it shone into the trees. A large flock of geese, nesting on the tops of the trees, was looking at us with a set of talons, as if they recognized us directly. My daughter even gave me a wave to shake her head at me, in case I was going out of my mind.        “Now…where did we go wrong?”          “You saw what I could do in those woods. You have to see it just like that, for yourself.”          “But I saw something…big. It didn’t move to me, it moved from out of this world…”        I shook my head. I saw the same thing twice more. I felt the grass beneath our feet loosen just enough to let the birds out of the trees, as two hands started to reach into that clearing and grab my daughter. One looked long and blacker than the other, and it was shaking with that same wild desperation. I threw the first rock at him, feeling for the best time for a swing. The second time, in an effort to be more creative, I turned and threw at the second one as they both hung. Both of them gave me a yell of surprise and pain, one of them grabbing my hand, the other dropping the twine over my feet, and they looked at each other strangely for about a minute before finally finding a more efficient route to the basket. They made it to the last part of the path and sat on opposite sides of the shade of the tree.          “There we go, we’re done here.”           “Fuck me,” my daughter hissed.            I threw one of my arm around her and we both climbed off. Through the treeline and into the trees, I saw the second one had climbed up to my right, but I ignored it and kept walking, avoiding the more direct route, which was the only one left. I thought about it frequently that day, and eventually, I decided I couldn’t go anywhere if I didn’t help first.           And that’s when the screaming started.           “Don’t you fucking look at me,” my daughter said in a tone that said more than she ever did in it. It rang in my mind, how we had found my daughter’s spirit, how, like a light switch, it had gone on and off and back at some point and I had no idea how it had gotten so far. But now she was speaking the words that she had so often used against me: only she knew.           “What kind of monster is he?” she asked.     “It’s too early to tell. I don’t want to give out the kind of answers you’re going to get from him.”         I looked at her. She was looking at me now, from all perspectives possible. With both hands, she moved both up and down, making sweeping motions with the front of her body that I couldn’t tell if she was doing so for balance or even to try to lift herself up from the ground.           “You’re not scary like him,” she mumbled\n",
